<h2>TEACHERS' AIDS</h2>
<p>Success with the Child's World Readers is in no wise dependent
on the use of the chart, manual, or cards.</p>

themselves by the use of cards, chart, and manual, and look to the
publisher to provide these accessories in convenient form and at
moderate cost.</p>
<p>The following aids are therefore offered in the belief that they
will make the work of the teacher, trained or untrained, more
effective.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>Long ago, on a high hill in Greece, Philemon and Baucis
lived.</p>
<p>They were poor, but they were never unhappy. They had many hives
of bees from which they got honey, and many vines from <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span> which they
gathered grapes. One old cow gave them all the milk that they could
use, and they had a little field in which grain was raised.</p>
<p>The old couple had as much as they needed, and were always ready
to share whatever they had with any one in want. No stranger was
ever turned from their door.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill lay a beautiful village, with pleasant
roads and rich pasture lands all around. But it was full of wicked,
selfish, people, who had no love in their hearts and thought only
of themselves.</p>
<p>At the time of this story, the people in the village were very
busy. Zeus, who they believed ruled the world, had sent word that
he was about to visit them. They were preparing a great feast and
making everything beautiful for his coming.</p>
<p>One evening, just at dark, two beggars came into the valley.
They stopped at every house and asked for food and a place to
sleep; but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id=
"page11"></a>{11}</span> the people were too busy or too tired to
attend to their needs. They were thinking only of the coming of
Zeus.</p>
<p>Footsore and weary, the two beggars at last climbed the hill to
the hut of Philemon and Baucis. These good people had eaten very
little, for they were saving their best food for Zeus.</p>
<p>When they saw the beggars, Philemon said, "Surely these men need
food more than Zeus. They look almost starved."</p>
<p>"Indeed, they do!" said Baucis, and she ran quickly to prepare
supper for the strangers.</p>
<p>She spread her best white cloth upon the table, and brought out
bacon, herbs, honey, grapes, bread, and milk. She set these upon
the table in all the best dishes she had and called the strangers
in.</p>
<p>Then what do you suppose happened? The dishes that the strangers
touched turned to gold. The pitcher was never empty, although they
drank glass after glass of milk. The loaf <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span> of bread
stayed always the same size, although the strangers cut slice after
slice.</p>
<p>"These are strange travelers," whispered the old couple to each
other. "They do wonderful things."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>That night Philemon and Baucis slept upon the floor that the
strangers might have their one bed. In the morning they went with
the travelers to the foot of the hill to see them safely started on
their way.</p>
<p>"Now, good people," said one of the strangers, "we thank you,
and whatever you wish shall be yours."</p>
<p>As he said this, his face became like that of the sun. Then
Philemon and Baucis knew that Zeus had spoken to them.</p>
<p>"Grant, O Zeus, that one of us may not outlive the other," they
cried in one voice.</p>
<p>"Your wish is granted," said Zeus; "yes, and more. Return to
your home and be happy."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig013.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig013.jpg" alt=
"Philemon and Baucis walking home" /></a></div>
<p>Philemon and Baucis turned homeward, and, lo! their hut was
changed to a beautiful castle.</p>
<p>The old people turned around to thank their guests, but they had
disappeared.</p>
<p>In this castle Philemon and Baucis lived many years. They still
did all they could for others, and were always so happy that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span>
never thought of wishing anything for themselves.</p>
<p>As the years passed, the couple grew very old and feeble. One
day Baucis said to Philemon, "I wish we might never die, but could
always live together."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is my wish, too!" sighed old Philemon.</p>
<p>The next morning the marble palace was gone; Baucis and Philemon
were gone; but there on the hilltop stood two beautiful trees, an
oak and a linden.</p>
<p>No one knew what became of the good people. After many years,
however, a traveler lying under the trees heard them whispering to
each other.</p>
<p>"Baucis," whispered the oak.</p>
<p>"Philemon," replied the linden.</p>
<p>There the trees stood through sun and rain, always ready to
spread their leafy shade over every tired stranger who passed that
way.</p>

<h2><a name="poplar" id="poplar">THE POPLAR TREE</a></h2>
<p>Long ago the poplar used to hold out its branches like other
trees. It tried to see how far it could spread them.</p>
<p>Once at sunset an old man came through the forest where the
poplar trees lived. The trees were going to sleep, and it was
growing dark.</p>
<p>The man held something under his cloak. It was a pot of
gold&mdash;the very pot of gold that lies at the foot of the
rainbow. He had stolen it and was looking for some place to hide
it. A poplar tree stood by the path.</p>
<p>"This is the very place to hide my treasure," the man said. "The
branches spread out straight, and the leaves are large and thick.
How lucky that the trees are all asleep!"</p>
<p>He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, and then ran
quickly away.</p>
<p>The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful maiden who had a
rainbow bridge to the earth. The next morning she missed her
precious pot. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id=
"page16"></a>{16}</span> It always lay at the foot of the rainbow,
but it was not there now.</p>
<p>Iris hurried away to tell her father, the great Zeus, of her
loss. He said that he would find the pot of gold for her.</p>
<p>He called a messenger, the swift-footed Mercury, and said, "Go
quickly, and do not return until you have found the treasure."</p>
<p>Mercury went as fast as the wind down to the earth. He soon came
to the forest and awakened the trees.</p>
<p>"Iris has lost her precious pot of gold that lies at the foot of
the rainbow. Have any of you seen it?" he asked.</p>
<p>The trees were very sleepy, but all shook their heads.</p>
<p>"We have not seen it," they said.</p>
<p>"Hold up your branches," said Mercury. "I must see that the pot
of gold is not hidden among them."</p>
<p>All of the trees held up their branches. The poplar that stood
by the path was the first to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
id="page17"></a>{17}</span> hold up his. He was an honest tree and
knew he had nothing to hide.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig017.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig017.jpg" alt=
"Mercury among the trees" /></a></div>
<p>Down fell the pot of gold. How surprised the poplar tree was! He
dropped his branches in shame. Then he held them high in the
air.</p>
<p>"Forgive me," he said. "I do not know how it came to be there;
but, hereafter, I shall always hold my branches up. Then every one
can see that I have nothing hidden."</p>
<p>Since then the branches have always grown straight up; and every
one knows that the poplar is an honest and upright tree.</p>

told me, and you told me."</p>
<p>"When did I tell you to sing?" asked his mate.</p>
<p>"Every time you brought in tender grass for the nest," he
replied. "Every time your soft wings fluttered off again for hair
and feathers to line it."</p>
<p>Then his mate asked, "What are you singing about?"</p>
<p>"I am singing about everything," he answered. "I sing because I
am happy."</p>
<p>By and by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and the
mother bird asked, "Is there anything in all the world as pretty as
my eggs?"</p>
<p>A week or two afterward, the mother said, "Oh, what do you think
has happened? One of my eggs has been peeping and moving."</p>
<p>Soon another egg moved, then another, and another, till five
eggs were hatched.</p>
<p>The little birds were so hungry that it kept <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>{22}</span> the parents
busy feeding them. Away they both flew. The moment the little birds
heard them coming back, five yellow mouths flew open wide.</p>
<p>"Can anybody be happier?" said the father bird to the mother
bird. "We will live in this tree always. It is a tree that bears
joy."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The very next day one of the birds dropped out of the nest, and
in a moment a cat ate it up. Only four remained, and the parent
birds were very sad. There was no song all that day, nor the
next.</p>
<p>Soon the little birds were big enough to fly. The first bird
that tried his wings flew from one branch to another. His parents
praised him, and the other baby birds wondered how he had done
it.</p>
<p>The little one was so proud of it that he tried again. He flew
and flew and couldn't stop flying. At last he fell plump! down by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span>
the kitchen door. A little boy caught him and carried him into the
house.</p>
<p>Now only three birds were left. The sun no longer seemed bright
to the birds, and they did not sing so often.</p>
<p>In a little time the other birds learned to use their wings, and
they flew away and away. They found their own food and made their
own nests.</p>
<p>Then the old birds sat silent and looked at each other a long
while. At last the mother bird asked, "Why don't you sing?"</p>
<p>"I can't sing," the father bird answered. "I only think and
think!"</p>
<p>"What are you thinking of?"</p>
<p>"I am thinking how everything changes. The leaves are falling,
and soon there will be no roof over our heads. The flowers are all
gone. Last night there was a frost. Almost all the birds have flown
away, and I am restless. Something calls me, and I feel that I must
fly away, too."</p>

<p>"Let us fly away together!" the mother bird said.</p>
<p>Then they rose silently up in the air. They looked to the north;
far away they saw the snow coming. They looked to the south; there
they saw green leaves.</p>
<p>All day they flew. All night they flew and flew, till they found
a land where there was no winter. There it was summer all the time;
flowers always blossomed and birds always sang.</p>

<h2><a name="new-dress" id="new-dress">HOW MARY GOT A NEW
DRESS</a></h2>
<p>Mary lived a long time ago. She was a little girl when your
great-great-grandmother was a little girl.</p>
<p>In those days all cloth had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt
Chloe, and Aunt Dilsey were kept busy spinning and weaving to make
clothes for the whole plantation.</p>
<p>One day Mary's mother said, "Aunt Dilsey, Mary needs a new
dress, and I want you to weave some cloth at once. Can you weave
some very fine cloth?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Aunt Dilsey. "I have some cotton I've been
saving to make her a dress."</p>
<p>Aunt Dilsey got out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and
fine. Then she fastened a roll of this cotton to the spindle and
sent the wheel whirling around with a
"Zum-m-m-m&mdash;Zum-m-m-m!"</p>
<p>Mary stood and watched the old woman.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>{27}</span>

"images/fig027.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig027.jpg" alt=
"Mary watching Aunt Dilsey at spinning wheel" /></a></div>
<p>"Aunt Dilsey," she said, "the spinning wheel sings a song, and I
know what it says. Grandmother told me. It says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'A hum and a whirl,</p>
<p>A twist and a twirl,</p>
<p>This is for the girl</p>
<p>With the golden curl!</p>
<p>Zum-m-m-m-m-m!</p>
<p>Zum-m-m-m-m-m!'"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"And that means you, honey," said Aunt Dilsey.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span>
<p>When the yarn was ready, Aunt Dilsey fastened it in the loom and
began to weave. The threads went over and under, over and under. As
Aunt Dilsey wove, she hummed. Mary stood by and sang this song,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Over and under and over we go,</p>
<p>Weaving the cotton as white as the snow,</p>
<p>Weaving the cloth for a dress, oh, ho!</p>
<p>As over and under and over we go."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After the cloth had been woven, Aunt Dilsey took it out of the
loom. Then she bleached it until it was as white as snow. Now it
was ready to be made into a dress.</p>
<p>"Mother, do tell me how you are going to make the dress," said
Mary. "Will it have ruffles on it like Sue's? Will it have trimming
on it? And how many buttons will you put on it? Sue's dress has
twelve; I know, for I counted them."</p>
<p>Mother did not answer all these questions; she just smiled as
the scissors went snip, snip into the cloth. But she did cut out
ruffles, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id=
"page29"></a>{29}</span> and Aunt Maria began to hem them.</p>

<p>By and by grandmother came into the room.</p>
<p>"Mary," she said, "here is some lace I got in England. Mother
may put it on your dress."</p>
<p>How happy Mary was! She danced for joy.</p>
<p>Mother put on the lace, and grandmother worked the buttonholes.
How many do you suppose she worked? Why, she worked twelve!</p>
<p>When the dress was finished, it was just like Sue's. Only it was
a great deal finer, for Mary's dress had three ruffles and Sue's
had only two! And, then, there was the lace from England!</p>

<h2><a name="plaid-dress" id="plaid-dress">THE PLAID DRESS</a></h2>
<p>"I want a warm plaid dress," said a little girl. "The days are
colder, and the frost will soon be here. But how can I get it?
Mother says that she cannot buy one for me."</p>
<p>The old white sheep in the meadow heard her, and he bleated to
the shepherd, "The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. I will
give my wool. Who else will help?"</p>
<p>The kind shepherd said, "I will." Then he led the old white
sheep to the brook and washed its wool. When it was clean and
white, he said, "The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. The
sheep has given his wool, and I have washed it clean and white. Who
else will help?"</p>
<p>"We will," said the shearers. "We will bring our shears and cut
off the wool."</p>
<p>The shearers cut the soft wool from the old sheep, and then they
called, "The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
wool. The shepherd has washed it; and we have sheared it. Who else
will help?"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig031.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig031.jpg" alt=
"Shearer shearing the sheep" /></a></div>
<p>"We will," cried the carders. "We will comb it out straight and
smooth."</p>
<p>Soon they held up the wool, carded straight and smooth, and they
cried, "The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his
wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it,
and we have carded it. Who else will help?"</p>
<p>"We will," said the spinners. "We will spin it into thread."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span>
<p>"Whirr, whirr!" How fast the spinning wheels turned, singing all
the time.</p>
<p>Soon the spinners said, "The little girl wants a new dress. The
sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The
shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it, and we have spun
it into thread. Who else will help?"</p>
<p>"We will," said the dyers. "We will dye it with beautiful
colors."</p>
<p>Then they dipped the woven threads into bright dye, red and blue
and green and brown.</p>
<p>As they spread the wool out to dry, the dyers called: "The
little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The
shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders
have carded it. The spinners have spun it, and we have dyed it with
bright beautiful colors. Who else will help?"</p>
<p>"We will," said the weavers. "We will make it into cloth."</p>

colored thread was woven over and under over and under. Before long
it was made into beautiful plaid cloth.</p>
<p>Then the little girl's mother cut and made the dress. It was a
beautiful plaid dress, and the little girl loved to wear it. Every
time she put it on, she thought of her friends who had helped
her,&mdash;the sheep, the shearers, the carders, the spinners, the
dyers, the weavers, and her own dear mother.</p>

<h2><a name="silkworm" id="silkworm">THE GODDESS OF THE
SILKWORM</a></h2>
<p>Hoangti was the emperor of China. He had a beautiful wife whose
name was Si-ling. The emperor and his wife loved their people and
always thought of their happiness.</p>
<p>In those days the Chinese people wore clothes made of skins. By
and by animals grew scarce, and the people did not know what they
should wear. The emperor and empress tried in vain to find some
other way of clothing them.</p>
<p>One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful palace
garden. They walked up and down, up and down, talking of their
people.</p>
<p>Suddenly the emperor said, "Look at those worms on the mulberry
trees, Si-ling. They seem to be spinning."</p>
<p>Si-ling looked, and sure enough, the worms were spinning. A long
thread was coming from the mouth of each, and each little worm was
winding this thread around its body.</p>
<p>Si-ling and the emperor stood still and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>{35}</span> watched the
worms. "How wonderful!" said Si-ling.</p>
<p>The next morning Hoangti and the empress walked under the trees
again. They found some worms still winding thread. Others had
already spun their cocoons and were fast asleep. In a few days all
of the worms had spun cocoons.</p>
<p>"This is indeed a wonderful, wonderful thing!" said Si-ling.
"Why, each worm has a thread on its body long enough to make a
house for itself!"</p>
<p>Si-ling thought of this day after day. One morning as she and
the emperor walked under the trees, she said, "I believe I could
find a way to weave those long threads into cloth."</p>
<p>"But how could you unwind the threads?" asked the emperor.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig036.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig036.jpg" alt=
"Hoangti and Si-ling walking among the trees" /></a></div>
<p>"I'll find a way," Si-ling said. And she did; but she had to try
many, many times.</p>
<p>She put the cocoons in a hot place, and the little sleepers soon
died. Then the cocoons <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=
"page36"></a>{36}</span> were thrown into boiling water to make the
threads soft. After that the long threads could be easily
unwound.</p>
<p>Now Si-ling had to think of something else; she had to find a
way to weave the threads into cloth. After many trials, she made a
loom&mdash;the first that was ever made. She taught others to
weave, and soon hundreds of people were making cloth from the
threads of the silkworm.</p>
<p>The people ever afterward called Si-ling "The Goddess of the
Silkworm." And whenever the emperor walked with her in the garden,
they liked to watch the silkworms spinning threads for the good of
their people.</p>

<h2><a name="flax" id="flax">THE FLAX</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>It was spring. The flax was in full bloom, and it had dainty
little blue flowers that nodded in the breeze.</p>
<p>"People say that I look very well," said the flax. "They say
that I am fine and long and that I shall make a beautiful piece of
linen. How happy I am! No one in the world can be happier."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said the fence post, "you may grow and be happy, and
you may sing, but you do not know the world as I do. Why, I have
knots in me." And it creaked;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Snip, snap, snurre,</p>
<p>Basse, lurre,</p>
<p>The song is ended."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"No, it is not ended," said the flax. "The sun will shine, and
the rain will fall, and I shall grow and grow. No, no, the song is
not ended."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>{38}</span>
<p>One day some men came with sharp reap hooks. They took the flax
by the head and cut it off at the roots. This was very painful, you
may be sure.</p>
<p>Then the flax was laid in water and was nearly drowned. After
that it was put on a fire and nearly roasted. All this was
frightful. But the flax only said, "One cannot be happy always. By
having bad times as well as good, we become wise."</p>
<p>After the flax had been cut and steeped and roasted, it was put
on a spinning wheel. "Whir-r-r, whir-rr-r," went the spinning
wheel; it went so fast that the flax could hardly think.</p>
<p>"I have been very happy in the sunshine and the rain," it said.
"If I am in pain now, I must be contented."</p>
<p>At last the flax was put in the loom. Soon it became a beautiful
piece of white linen.</p>
<p>"This is very wonderful," said the flax. "How foolish the fence
post was with its song of&mdash;</p>

<p>Basse, lurre,</p>
<p>The song is ended.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The song is not ended, I am sure. It has only just begun.</p>
<p>"After all that I have suffered, I am at last made into
beautiful linen. How strong and fine I am, and how long and white!
This is even better than being a plant bearing flowers. I have
never been happier than I am now."</p>
<p>After some time the linen was cut into pieces and sewed with
needles. That was not pleasant; but at last there were twelve
pretty white aprons.</p>
<p>"See," said the flax, "I have been made into something. Now I
shall be of some use in the world. That is the only way to be
happy."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Years passed by, and the linen was so worn that it could hardly
hold together.</p>
<p>"The end must come soon," said the flax.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span>
<p>At last the linen did fall into rags and tatters; it was torn
into shreds and boiled in water. The flax thought the end had
come.</p>
<p>But no, the end was not yet. After being made into pulp and
dried, the flax became beautiful white paper.</p>
<p>"This is a surprise, a glorious surprise," it said. "I am finer
than ever, and I shall have fine things written on me. How happy I
am!"</p>
<p>And sure enough, the most beautiful stories and verses were
written upon it. People read the stories and verses, and they were
made wiser and better. Their children and their children's children
read them, too, and so the song was not ended.</p>

"The Hillman at the housewife's door" /></a></div>
<p>As every one knows, fairies are always just. They are kind to
others, and in return they expect others to be kind to them. In
some countries across the sea there are fairies called Hillmen.</p>
<p>Now, there once lived a certain housewife who liked to make
bargains. She gave away only those things for which she had no use,
and then expected always to get something in return.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span>
<p>One day a Hillman knocked at her door.</p>
<p>"Can you lend us a saucepan?" he asked. "There's a wedding on
the hill, and all the pots are in use."</p>
<p>"Is he to have one?" whispered the servant who opened the
door.</p>
<p>"Aye, to be sure," answered the housewife; "one must be
neighborly. Get the saucepan for him, lass."</p>
<p>The maid turned to take a good saucepan from the shelf, but the
housewife stopped her.</p>
<p>"Not that, not that," she whispered. "Get the old one out of the
cupboard. It leaks, but that doesn't matter. The Hillmen are so
neat and are such nimble workers that they are sure to mend it
before they send it home. I can oblige the fairies and save
sixpence in tinkering, too."</p>
<p>The maid brought the old saucepan that had been laid by until
the tinker's next visit, and gave it to the Hillman. He thanked her
and went away.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span>
<p>When the saucepan was returned, it had been neatly mended, just
as the housewife thought it would be.</p>
<p>At night the maid filled the pan with milk and set it on the
fire to heat for the children's supper. In a few moments the milk
was so smoked and burnt that no one would touch it. Even the pigs
refused to drink it.</p>
<p>"Ah, you good-for-nothing!" cried the housewife. "There's a
quart of milk wasted at once."</p>
<p>"And that's twopence," cried a queer little voice that seemed to
come from the chimney.</p>
<p>The housewife filled the saucepan again and set it over the
fire. It had not been there more than two minutes before it boiled
over and was burnt and smoked as before.</p>
<p>"The pan must be dirty," muttered the woman, who was very much
vexed. "Two full quarts of milk have been wasted."</p>
<p>"And that's fourpence!" added the queer little voice from the
chimney.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span>
<p>The saucepan was scoured; then it was filled with milk the third
time and set over the fire. Again the milk boiled over and was
spoiled.</p>
<p>Now the housewife was quite vexed. "I have never had anything
like this to happen since I first kept house," she exclaimed.
"Three quarts of milk wasted!"</p>
<p>"And that's sixpence," cried the queer little voice from the
chimney. "You didn't save the tinkering after all, mother!"</p>
<p>With that the Hillman himself came tumbling from the chimney and
ran off laughing. But from that time, the saucepan was as good as
any other.</p>

<h2><a name="bell" id="bell">THE BELL OF ATRI</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Good King John of Atri loved his people very much and wished to
see them happy. He knew, however, that some were not; he knew that
many suffered wrongs which were not righted. This made him sad.</p>
<p>One day the king thought of a way to help his people. He had a
great bell hung in a tower in the market place. He had the rope
made so long that a child could reach it.</p>
<p>Then the king sent heralds through the streets to tell the
people why he had put the bell in the market place. The heralds
blew their trumpets long and loud, and the people came from their
homes to hear the message.</p>
<p>"Know ye," cried a herald, "that whenever a wrong is done to any
man, he has but to ring the great bell in the square. A judge will
go to the tower to hear the complaint, and he will see that justice
is done."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>{49}</span>
<p>"Long live our good king!" shouted the people. "Now our wrongs
shall be righted."</p>
<p>And so it was. Whenever anyone was wronged, he rang the bell in
the tower. The judge put on his rich robes and went there. He
listened to the complaint, and the guilty were punished.</p>
<p>The people in Atri were now very happy, and the days went
swiftly by. The bell hung in its place year after year, and it was
rung many times. By and by the rope became so worn that one could
scarcely reach it.</p>
<p>The king said, "Why, a child could not reach the rope now, and a
wrong might not be righted. I must put in a new one."</p>
<p>So he ordered a rope from a distant town. In those days it took
a long time to travel from one town to another. What should they do
if somebody wished to ring the bell before the new rope came?</p>
<p>"We must mend the rope in some way," said a man.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span>
<p>"Here," said another; "take this piece of grapevine and fasten
it to the rope. Then it will be long enough for any one to
reach."</p>
<p>This was done, and for some time the bell was rung in that
way.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>One hot summer noon everything was very still. All the people
were indoors taking their noonday rest.</p>
<p>Suddenly they were awakened by the arousing bell:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Some one&mdash;hath done&mdash;a wrong,</p>
<p>Hath done&mdash;a wrong!</p>
<p>Hath done&mdash;a wrong!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The judge started from a deep sleep, turned on his couch, and
listened. Could it be the bell of justice?</p>
<p>Again the sound came:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Some one&mdash;hath done&mdash;a wrong!</p>
<p>Hath done&mdash;a wrong!</p>
<p>Hath done&mdash;a wrong!</p>
</div>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span>
<p>It was the bell of justice. The judge put on his rich robes and,
panting, hurried to the market place.</p>
<p>There he saw a strange sight: a poor steed, starved and thin,
tugging at the vines which were fastened to the bell. A great crowd
had gathered around.</p>
<p>"Whose horse is this?" the judge asked.</p>
<p>"It is the horse of the rich soldier who lives in the castle,"
said a man. "He has served his master long and well, and has saved
his life many times. Now that the horse is too old to work, the
master turns him out. He wanders through the lanes and fields,
picking up such food as can be found."</p>
<p>"His call for justice shall be heard," said the judge. "Bring
the soldier to me."</p>
<p>The soldier tried to treat the matter as a jest. Then he grew
angry and said in an undertone, "One can surely do what he pleases
with his own."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig052.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig052.jpg" alt=
"The judge sees the horse in the market place" /></a></div>
<p>"For shame!" cried the judge. "Has the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> horse not
served you for many years? And has he not saved your life? You must
build a good shelter for him, and give him the best grain and the
best pasture. Take the horse home and be as true to him as he has
been to you."</p>
<p>The soldier hung his head in shame and led the horse away. The
people shouted and applauded.</p>
<p>"Great is King John," they cried, "and great the bell of
Atri!"</p>

<h2><a name="witness" id="witness">A DUMB WITNESS</a></h2>
<p>One day at noontime a poor man was riding along a road. He was
tired and hungry, and wished to stop and rest. Finding a tree with
low branches, he tied his horse to one of them. Then he sat down to
eat his dinner.</p>
<p>Soon a rich man came along and started to tie his horse to the
same tree.</p>
<p>"Do not fasten your horse to that tree," cried the poor man. "My
horse is savage and he may kill yours. Fasten him to another
tree."</p>
<p>"I shall tie my horse where I wish," the rich man replied; and
he tied his horse to the same tree. Then he, too, sat down to
eat.</p>
<p>Very soon the men heard a great noise. They looked up and saw
that their horses were kicking and fighting. Both men rushed to
stop them, but it was too late; the rich man's horse was dead.</p>
<p>"See what your horse has done!" cried the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> rich man in
an angry voice. "But you shall pay for it! You shall pay for
it!"</p>
<p>Then he dragged the man before a judge.</p>
<p>"Oh, wise judge," he cried, "I have come to you for justice. I
had a beautiful, kind, gentle horse which has been killed by this
man's savage horse. Make the man pay for the horse or send him to
prison."</p>
<p>"Not so fast, my friend," the judge said. "There are two sides
to every case."</p>
<p>He turned to the poor man. "Did your horse kill this man's
horse?" he asked.</p>
<p>The poor man made no reply.</p>
<p>The judge asked in surprise, "Are you dumb? Can you not
talk?"</p>
<p>But no word came from the poor man's lips.</p>
<p>Then the judge turned to the rich man.</p>
<p>"What more can I do?" he asked. "You see for yourself this poor
man cannot speak."</p>
<p>"Oh, but he can," cried the rich man. "He spoke to me."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said the judge. "When?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span>
<p>"He spoke to me when I tied my horse to the tree."</p>
<p>"What did he say?" asked the judge.</p>
<p>"He said, 'Do not fasten your horse to that tree. My horse is
savage and may kill yours.'"</p>
<p>"0 ho!" said the judge. "This poor man warned you that his horse
was savage, and you tied your horse near his after the warning.
This puts a new light on the matter. You are to blame, not he."</p>
<p>The judge turned to the poor man and said, "My man, why did you
not answer my questions?"</p>
<p>"Oh, wise judge," said the poor man, "if I had told you that I
warned him not to tie his horse near mine, he would have denied it.
Then how could you have told which one of us to believe? I let him
tell his own story, and you have learned the truth."</p>
<p>This speech pleased the judge. He praised the poor man for his
wisdom, and sent the rich man away without a penny.</p>

<p>TIME: A fine morning in spring.</p>
<p>(The hedgehog is standing by his door looking at the cabbage
field which he thinks is his own.)</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Wife, have you dressed the children yet?</p>
<p>WIFE: Just through, my dear.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Well, come out here and let us look at our cabbage
patch.</p>
<p>(Wife comes out.)</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Fine crop, isn't it? We should be happy.</p>
<p>WIFE: The cabbage is fine enough, but I can't see why we should
be so happy.</p>

<p>HEDGEHOG: Why, my dear, there are tears in your voice. What is
the matter?</p>
<p>WIFE: I suppose I ought not to mind it, but those dreadful hares
nearly worry the life out of me.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: What are they doing now?</p>
<p>WIFE: Doing? What are they not doing? Why, yesterday I brought
my pretty babies out here to get some cabbage leaves. We were
eating as well-behaved hedgehogs always eat, and those horrid hares
almost made us cry.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: What did they do?</p>
<p>WIFE: They came to our cabbage patch and they giggled and said,
"Oh, see the little duck-legged things! Aren't they funny?" Then
one jumped over a cabbage just to hurt our feelings.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Well, they are mean, I know, but we won't notice them.
I'll get <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id=

there comes one of them now.</p>
<p>WIFE: Yes, and he laughed at me yesterday. He said,
"Good-morning, Madam Shortlegs." I won't speak to him. I'll hide
till he goes by.</p>
<p>(Wife hides behind a cabbage.)</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Good-morning, sir.</p>
<p>HARE: Are you speaking to me?</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Certainly; do you see any one else around?</p>
<p>HARE: How dare you speak to me?</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Oh, just to be neighborly.</p>
<p>HARE: I shall ask you not to speak to me hereafter. I think
myself too good to notice hedgehogs.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Now, that is strange.</p>
<p>HARE: What is strange?</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Why, I have just said to my wife that we wouldn't
notice you.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span>
<p>HARE: Wouldn't notice me, indeed, you silly, short-legged,
duck-legged thing!</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Well, my legs are quite as good as yours, sir.</p>
<p>HARE: As good as mine! Who ever heard of such a thing? Why, you
can do little more than crawl.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: That may be as you say, but I'll run a race with you
any day.</p>
<p>HARE: Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! A race with a hedgehog! Well,
well, well!</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Are you afraid to run with me?</p>
<p>HARE: Of course not. It will be no race at all, but I'll run
just to show you how silly you are.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Good! You run in that furrow; I will run in this. We
shall see who gets to the fence first. Let's start from the far end
of the furrow.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>{62}</span>

there. Go ahead.</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: I wouldn't stay too long if I were you.</p>
<p>HARE: Oh, I'll be back before you reach the end of the
furrow.</p>
<p>(The hare runs off to the brook.)</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>HEDGEHOG: Wife, wife, did you hear what I said to the hare?</p>
<p>WIFE: Did I hear? I should say I did. What are you thinking of?
Have you lost your senses?</p>
<p>HEDGEHOG: You shouldn't speak that way to me. What do you know
about a man's business? Come here and let me whisper something to
you.</p>

<h2><a name="epaminondas" id="epaminondas">EPAMINONDAS</a></h2>
<p>Epaminondas had a good kind granny, who cooked at "the big
house." Epaminondas liked to go to see her, for she always gave him
something to take home with him.</p>
<p>One day when Epaminondas went to see granny, she was baking a
cake, and she gave Epaminondas a piece to eat. As he was leaving,
granny said, "Epaminondas, you may take a slice home to your
mammy."</p>
<p>Epaminondas took it in his little hands and squeezing it just as
tight as he could, ran all the way home. When his mammy saw him,
she said, "What's that, Epaminondas?"</p>
<p>"Cake, mammy. Granny sent it to you."</p>
<p>"Cake!" cried his mammy. "Epaminondas, don't you know that's no
way to carry cake? When your granny gives you cake, put it in your
hat; then put your hat on your head and come home. You hear me,
Epaminondas?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mammy."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>{68}</span>
<p>The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she was
churning, and she gave him a pat of fresh butter to carry to his
mammy.</p>
<p>Epaminondas said to himself, "What was it mammy said? Oh, yes! I
know. She said, 'Put it in your hat and put the hat on your head
and come home.' I'll do just what she told me."</p>
<p>Epaminondas put the pat of butter in his hat, put his hat on his
head, and went home.</p>
<p>It was a hot day, and soon the butter began to melt. Drip, drip,
drip, it went into his ears. Drip, drip, drip, it went into his
eyes. Drip, drip, drip, it went down his back. When Epaminondas
reached home, he had no butter in his hat. It was all on him.</p>
<p>Looking at him hard, his mammy said, "Epaminondas, what in the
world is that dripping from your hat?"</p>
<p>"Butter, mammy. Granny sent it to you."</p>
<p>"Butter!" cried his mammy. "Oh, Epaminondas! Don't you know how
to carry butter? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id=
"page69"></a>{69}</span> You must wrap it in a cabbage leaf, and
take it to the spring. Then you must cool it in the water, and cool
it in the water, and cool it in the water. When you have done this,
take the butter in your hands and come home. You hear me,
Epaminondas?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mammy."</p>
<p>The next time Epaminondas went to see his granny, she wasn't
baking cake and she wasn't churning. She was sitting in a chair
knitting.</p>
<p>She said, "Epaminondas, look in the woodshed, and you'll see
something you like."</p>
<p>Epaminondas looked in the woodshed, and there he found four
little puppies. He played with them all the afternoon, and when he
started home, his granny gave him one.</p>
<p>Epaminondas remembered what his mammy had told him. He wrapped
the puppy in a big cabbage leaf, and took it to the spring. He
cooled it in the water, and cooled it in the water, and cooled it
in the water. Then he took it in his hands, and went home.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span>
<p>When his mammy saw him, she said, "Epaminondas, what is that in
your hands?"</p>
<p>"A puppy dog, mammy."</p>
<p>"A puppy dog!" cried his mammy. "Oh, Epaminondas! What makes you
act so foolish? That's no way to carry a puppy. The way to carry a
puppy is to tie a string around his neck and put him on the ground.
Then you take the other end of the string in your hand and come
along home. You hear me, Epaminondas?"</p>
<p>"Yes, mammy."</p>
<p>Epaminondas was going to be right the next time; he got a piece
of string and put it in his pocket to have it ready.</p>
<p>The next day company came to see Epaminondas's mammy, and she
had no bread for dinner. She called Epaminondas and said, "Run to
'the big house' and ask your granny to send me a loaf of bread for
dinner."</p>
<p>"Yes, mammy," said Epaminondas. And off he ran.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span>
<p>Granny gave him a loaf just from the oven&mdash;a nice, brown,
crusty loaf. This time Epaminondas was certainly going to do what
mammy had told him.</p>
<p>He proudly got out his string and tied it to the loaf. Then he
put the loaf on the ground, and taking the other end of the string
in his hand, he went along home.</p>
<p>When he reached home, his mammy gave one look at the thing tied
to the end of the string.</p>
<p>"What have you brought, Epaminondas?" she cried.</p>
<p>"Bread, mammy. Granny sent it to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, Epaminondas! Epaminondas! How could you be so foolish?"
cried his mammy. "Now I have no bread for dinner. I'll have to go
and get some myself."</p>
<p>She went into the house and got her bonnet. When she came out,
she said, "Epaminondas, do you see those three mince pies I've put
on the doorstep to cool. Well, now, you hear <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span> me,
Epaminondas. You be careful how you step on those pies!"</p>
<p>"Yes, mammy."</p>
<p>His mammy went off down the road; Epaminondas went to the door
and looked out. "Mammy told me to be careful how I step on those
mince pies," he said, "so I must be careful how I do it. I'll step
right in the middle of every one."</p>
<p>And he did!</p>
<p>When his mammy came home, there were no pies for dinner.</p>
<p>Now she was angry all over, and something happened. I don't
know, and you don't know, but we can guess.</p>

<p>One day Brother Rabbit was running along on the sand, lippety,

he saw the whale and the elephant talking together.</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit said, "I'd like to know what they are talking
about." So he crouched down behind some bushes and listened.</p>

<p>"You are the biggest thing on the land, Brother Elephant, and I
am the biggest thing in the sea. If we work together, we can rule

everything."</p>
<p>"Very good, very good," trumpeted the elephant. "That suits me.
You keep the sea, and I will keep the land."</p>

<p>"That's a bargain," said the whale, as he swam away.</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit laughed to himself. "They won't rule me," he
said, as he ran off.</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit soon came back with a very long and a very strong
rope and his big drum. He hid the drum in some bushes. Then taking
one end of the rope, he walked up to the elephant.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear Mr. Elephant," he said, "you are big and strong; will
you have the kindness to do me a favor?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span>
<p>The elephant was pleased, and he trumpeted, "Certainly,
certainly. What is it?"</p>
<p>"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore, and I can't pull her
out," said Brother Rabbit. "If you will help me, you will do me a
great service. You are so strong, I am sure you can get her
out."</p>
<p>"Certainly, certainly," trumpeted the elephant.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said the rabbit. "Take this rope in your trunk, and
I will tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my drum to let
you know when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for the
cow is very heavy."</p>
<p>"Huh!" trumpeted the elephant, "I'll pull her out, or break the
rope."</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit tied the rope to the elephant's trunk and ran
off, lippety, lippety.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>He ran till he came to the shore where the whale was. Making a
bow, Brother Rabbit said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
id="page76"></a>{76}</span> "0, mighty and wonderful Whale, will
you do me a favor?"</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked the whale.</p>
<p>"My cow is stuck in the mud on the shore," said Brother Rabbit,
"and I cannot pull her out. Of course you can do it. If you will be
so kind as to help me, I shall be very much obliged."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said the whale, "certainly."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Brother Rabbit, "take hold of this rope, and I
will tie the other end to my cow. Then I will beat my big drum to
let you know when to pull. You must pull as hard as you can, for my
cow is very heavy."</p>
<p>"Never fear," said the whale, "I could pull a dozen cows out of
the mud."</p>
<p>"I am sure you could," said the rabbit politely. "Only be sure
to begin gently. Then pull harder and harder till you get her
out."</p>
<p>The rabbit ran away into the bushes where he had hidden the drum
and began to beat it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id=
"page77"></a>{77}</span> Then the whale began to pull and the
elephant began to pull. In a minute the rope tightened till it was
stretched as hard as a bar of iron.</p>
<p>"This is a very heavy cow," said the elephant, "but I'll pull
her out." Bracing his fore feet in the earth, he gave a tremendous
pull.</p>
<p>But the whale had no way to brace himself.</p>
<p>"Dear me," he said. "That cow must surely be stuck tight."
Lashing his tail in the water, he gave a marvelous pull.</p>
<p>He pulled harder; the elephant pulled harder. Soon the whale
found himself sliding toward the land. He was so provoked with the
cow that he went head first, down to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>That was a pull! The elephant was jerked off his feet, and came
slipping and sliding toward the sea. He was very angry.</p>
<p>"That cow must be very strong to drag me in this way," he said.
"I will brace myself."</p>
<p>Kneeling down on the ground, he twisted <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span> the rope
around his trunk. Then he began to pull his very best, and soon the
whale came up out of the water.</p>
<p>Then each saw that the other had hold of the rope.</p>
<p>"How is this?" cried the whale. "I thought I was pulling Brother
Rabbit's cow."</p>
<p>"That is what I thought," said the elephant. "Brother Rabbit is
making fun of us. He must pay for this. I forbid him to eat a blade
of grass on land, because he played a trick on us."</p>
<p>"And I will not allow him to drink a drop of water in the sea,"
said the whale.</p>
<p>But Little Rabbit sat in the bushes and laughed, and laughed,
and laughed.</p>
<p>"Much do I care," he said. "I can get all the green things I
want, and I don't like salt water."</p>

"The church tower" /></a></div>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Long, long ago, in a far away city, there was a large church.
The tower of this church was so high that it seamed to touch the
clouds, and in the high tower there were three wonderful bells.
When they rang, they made sweet music.</p>
<p>There was something strange about these bells. They were never
heard to ring except on Christmas eve, and no one knew who rang
them. Some people thought it was the wind blowing through the
tower. Others thought the angels rang them when a gift pleased the
Christ Child.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span>
<p>Although the people did not know what rang the bells, they loved
to hear them. They would come from miles around to listen to the
wonderful music. When they had heard the bells, they would go out
of the church, silent but happy. Then all would go back to their
homes feeling that Christmas had come, indeed.</p>
<p>One Christmas eve the people in the church waited and waited,
but the bells did not ring. Silently and sadly they went home.
Christmas after Christmas came and went. Nearly one hundred years
passed by, and in all that time the bells did not ring.</p>
<p>People sometimes asked one another, "Do you suppose the bells
ever did ring?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said one very old man. "I have often heard my father tell
how beautifully they rang on Christmas eve. There was more love in
the world then."</p>
<p>Every Christmas eve the church was filled with people who waited
and listened. They hoped that the bells would ring again as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span>
had rung long ago. Though many gifts were laid on the altar, still
the bells did not ring.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Christmas was near at hand again, and every one was happy.</p>
<p>Not far from the city two little brothers lived on a
farm&mdash;Pedro and Little Brother.</p>
<p>Their father was poor and had no gift to lay on the altar. But
Pedro had saved all his earnings, and he had one shining silver
piece. His father had promised the little boys that they might go
to the church on Christmas eve and take the gift.</p>
<p>It was quite dark when the lads started on their way to the
city. The snow was falling fast, but they buttoned their little
jackets close about them and walked along briskly. They were not
far from the church when they heard a low whine of distress. Little
Brother, clinging to Pedro in fear, cried, "What is it, Pedro, what
is it?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span>
<p>Pedro ran across the street, and there under a small heap of
snow, what do you think he found? A little black and white dog,
shivering with cold, and nearly starved. Pedro opened his jacket,
and put the dog inside to keep it warm.</p>
<p>"You will have to go to the church alone, Little Brother," Pedro
said. "I must take this little dog back to the farm, and give it
food, else it will die."</p>
<p>"But I don't want to go alone, Pedro," said Little Brother.</p>
<p>"Won't you please go and put my gift on the altar, Little
Brother? I wish so much to have it there to-night."</p>
<p>"Yes, Pedro, I will," said Little Brother.</p>
<p>He took the gift and started toward the church. Pedro turned and
went home.</p>
<p>When Little Brother came to the great stone church and looked up
at the high tower, he felt that he could not go in alone. He stood
outside a long time watching the people as <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span> they passed
in. At last he entered quietly and took a seat in a corner.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>When Little Brother went into the church, all the people were
seated. They sat quietly hoping that at last the bells would ring
again as in the days of old.</p>
<p>The organ pealed out a Christmas hymn. The choir and the people
arose, and all sang the grand old anthem. Then a solemn voice said,
"Bring now your gifts to the altar."</p>
<p>The king arose and went forward with stately tread. Bowing
before the altar, he laid upon it his golden crown. Then he walked
proudly back to his seat. All the people listened, but the bells
did not ring.</p>
<p>Then the queen arose and with haughty step walked to the front.
She took from her neck and wrists her beautiful jewels and laid
them upon the altar. All the people listened, but the bells did not
ring.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span>
<p>Then the soldiers came marching proudly forward. They took their
jeweled swords from their belts and laid them upon the altar. All
the people listened, but the bells did not ring.</p>
<p>Then the rich men came hurrying forward. They counted great sums
of gold and laid them in a businesslike way upon the altar. All the
people listened, but the bells did not ring.</p>
<p>"Can I go all alone to the front of the church and lay this
small gift on the altar?" said Little Brother. "Oh, how can I? how
can I?"</p>
<p>Then he said, "But I told Pedro I would, and I must."</p>
<p>So he slipped slowly around by the outer aisle. He crept quietly
up to the altar and softly laid the silver piece upon the very
edge.</p>
<p>And listen! What do you think was heard? The bells, the
bells!</p>
<p>Oh, how happy the people were! And how happy Little Brother was!
He ran out of the church and down the road toward the farm.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span>
<p>Pedro had warmed the dog and fed it, and was now on the way to
the city. He hoped that he might see the people come out of the
church.</p>
<p>Down the road Little Brother came running. Throwing himself into
Pedro's arms, he cried, "Oh, Pedro, Pedro! The bells, the bells! I
wish you could have heard them; and they rang when I laid your gift
on the altar."</p>
<p>"I did hear them, Little Brother," said Pedro. "Their sound came
to me over the snow,&mdash;the sweetest music I ever heard."</p>
<p>Long years after, when Pedro grew to be a man, he was a great
musician. Many, many people came to hear him play.</p>
<p>Some one said to him one day, "How can you play so sweetly? I
never heard such music before."</p>
<p>"Ah," said Pedro, "but you never heard the Christmas bells as I
heard them that Christmas night years and years ago."</p>

<h2><a name="squeaky" id="squeaky">SQUEAKY AND THE SCARE
BOX</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Once upon a time a family of mice lived in the pantry wall.
There was a father mouse, there was a mother mouse, and there were
three little baby mice.</p>
<p>One little mouse had sharp bright eyes and could see everything,
even in the darkest holes. He was called Sharpeyes. His brother
could sniff and smell anything, wherever it might be hidden, and he
was called Sniffy. The baby mouse had such a squeaky little voice
that he was called Squeaky. He was always singing, "Ee-ee-ee!"</p>
<p>Mother mouse was very wise, and she had taught her babies to run
and hide when they saw the old cat coming. She had also taught them
not to go near a trap. The little mice obeyed their mother, and
they were happy in their home in the pantry wall.</p>
<p>They had many good times together. I could <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> not tell you
about all of these, but I am going to tell you about their
Christmas party and what happened to Squeaky.</p>
<p>It was the night before Christmas. The stockings hung by the
chimney, and the tall tree was standing in the parlor. The children
were asleep, and the father and mother had gone upstairs to
bed.</p>
<p>In the pantry wall, the little mice were all wide-awake.</p>
<p>"Ee-ee-ee!" squeaked Squeaky; "why can't we creep into the big
room and see the tall Christmas tree? The children have talked
about it for days, and we have never seen one. Mother, please let
us go and see it."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sniffy, "do let us go. Everything smells so good.
The children and the cook made long strings of pop corn to-day. I
found a little on the pantry floor, and I want some more."</p>
<p>"I peeped out of our hole," said Sharpeyes, "and I saw cake and
candy all ready for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id=
"page92"></a>{92}</span> children. Oh, I do want a bite of those
good things! Please let us have a Christmas party."</p>
<p>"Well," said mother mouse, "I will ask your father. If he says
it is safe, we will go."</p>
<p>When mother mouse asked father mouse, he said, "I will go out
first and look all about. If it is safe, I will come back for
you."</p>
<p>So father mouse crept softly through the pantry, down the long
hall, and into the parlor. The cat was nowhere to be seen. Father
mouse ran back to the pantry and cried, "The cat is not near; come
and see the tree."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Then all the mice came scampering from the hole in the wall.
They crept through the pantry, down the long hall, and into the
parlor. When they saw the tall Christmas tree, they squeaked again
and again in their joy. Then they ran around and around the tree to
see what was on it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig093.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig093.jpg" alt=
"The mice look at the Christmas tree" /></a></div>
<p>On the floor they saw a wonderful doll's house. "How fine it
would be to live there!" they squeaked.</p>
<p>They ran up and down the stairs, sat on the chairs, and lay down
in the beds. Oh, they had a merry time!</p>
<p>Then Sniffy said, "I smell that good pop corn again. Let's climb
up into the Christmas tree and get some."</p>
<p>They climbed up into the tree. They nibbled <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> the pop
corn; they nibbled the candy; they nibbled the nuts; and they
nibbled the cakes.</p>
<p>Soon Sharpeyes cried out, "Come here, I see a mouse! I see a
mouse! But he doesn't look like our family at all."</p>
<p>"I should say not," sniffed Sniffy; "and how good he
smells!"</p>
<p>"Why, he is good to eat!" squeaked Squeaky; and they all began
to eat the chocolate mouse.</p>
<p>Then they found another candy mouse&mdash;a pretty pink one.
They were so busy eating it that they forgot to watch and listen;
then&mdash;bang! The door was opened, and the lights were turned
on.</p>
<p>With a squeak, the mice scampered down from the tree; then they
ran along the hall, through the pantry, and back to their home.
There was the father mouse, and the mother mouse, and Sharpeyes,
and Sniffy. But where was Squeaky?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Now, as Squeaky tried to run down the tree, he fell heels over
head. Down, down, down, he fell until he was caught in a funny box.
An ugly man with black hair and black whiskers seemed to be hopping
out of the box.</p>
<p>When Squeaky saw the lights turned on, he hid under the dress of
this queer man. He lay very, very still, for he had been taught to
be still when danger was near. He heard voices. The father and
mother had come back.</p>
<p>"Yes," the father was saying; "it would have been a shame to
forget this train. I would like it to come right out from under the
tree. Help me put the track down, mother."</p>
<p>When the train was just where it should be, the mother turned to
the beautiful tree.</p>
<p>"Why, look at that Jack-in-the-box," she said. "The man is
hanging out. That will never do. I will shut the box. Teddy must
see the man jump out."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span>
<p>The mother pushed the man with the black hair down, down, into
the box and shut the lid. Poor Squeaky felt the springs close down
on him and squeaked, "Ee-ee-"</p>
<p>"That was a fine squeak," said the father. "The toys are
wonderful these days."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the mother, as she turned off the light. "When I was
a child, we did not have such toys."</p>
<p>"I am in a trap," said poor Squeaky, "but there isn't even a bit
of cheese in it. I wonder what kind of trap it is; nothing seems to
hurt me. Well, I am safe for a while, and I hope I shall soon get
out."</p>
<p>Squeaky lay in the box all night, and wondered what Sniffy and
Sharpeyes were doing. The next morning, he heard children calling,
"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!" And soon the toys were taken
down, one by one. Then such a noise was heard&mdash;drums beating,
horns tooting, children shouting. You should have heard it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span>

"images/fig097.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig097.jpg" alt=
"The mother is surprised as Squeaky escapes" /></a></div>
<p>"See our new doll's house!" cried one child.</p>
<p>"See my new train! How fast it goes!" cried another.</p>
<p>"And see my beautiful dolly!" cried another. "She can open and
shut her eyes."</p>
<p>By and by the mother took the box from the tree. "Come here,
Teddy," she said. "Here is a scare box. We will have some fun.
Watch me open the lid."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span>
<p>Teddy stood by his mother and watched closely.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" asked his mother. "Well, let us count. One,
two, three!"</p>
<p>The lid flew open, and out jumped the man with the black hair
and black whiskers. And with a squeak of joy, out jumped the
mouse.</p>
<p>"Ee-ee-ee!" he cried, as he ran away.</p>
<p>"Ee!" said the Jack-in-the-box.</p>
<p>"Whee-ee-ee!" cried the boy with delight.</p>
<p>"Oh,&mdash;a mouse! a mouse!" cried the mother. Then she threw
the box on the floor and jumped up on her chair.</p>
<p>"Where? where?" cried all the children.</p>
<p>But they saw only the tip of Squeaky's tail as he ran across the
hall to the pantry. Another moment and he was safe in the hole in
the pantry wall.</p>
<p>The children's father laughed as he helped their mother climb
down from the chair.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "how did <i>you</i> enjoy Teddy's scare
box?"</p>

<p>"What a dreary day it is!" grumbled the old gray goose to the
brown hen. They were standing at the henhouse window watching the
falling snow which covered every nook and corner of the
farmyard.</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," said the brown hen. "I should almost be willing

nothing to eat or drink since early in the morning. The cold wind
howled around their house. Hour after hour went by, but no one came
near the henhouse.</p>
<p>The handsome white rooster, however, seemed as happy as usual.
That is saying a great deal, for a jollier old fellow than he never
lived in a farmyard. Sunshine, rain, or snow were all the same to
him, and he crowed quite as merrily in stormy weather as in
fair.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, laughing, as he looked about the henhouse, "you
all seem to be having a fit of dumps."</p>
<p>Nobody answered the white rooster, but a faint cluck or two came
from some of the hens. They immediately put their heads back under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id=
"page102"></a>{102}</span> their wings, however, as if ashamed of
having spoken at all.</p>
<p>This was too much for the white rooster. He stood first on one
yellow foot and then on the other. Turning his head from side to
side, he said, "What's the use of looking so sad? Any one would
think that you expected to be eaten by a band of hungry foxes."</p>
<p>Just then a brave little white bantam rooster hopped down from
his perch. He strutted over to the big rooster and caused quite a
flutter in the henhouse by saying:</p>
<p>"We're lively enough when our crops are full, but when we are
starving, it is a wonder that we can hold our heads up at all. If I
ever see that farmer's boy again, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll peck
his foot!"</p>
<p>"You won't see him until he feeds us," said the white rooster,
"and then I guess you will peck his corn."</p>
<p>"Oh, oh!" moaned the brown hen. "Don't speak of a peck of
corn."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
"page103"></a>{103}</span>
<p>"Madam," said the white rooster, bowing very low, "your trouble
is my own,&mdash;that is, I'm hungry, too. But we might be worse
off. We might be in a box on our way to market. It is true that we
haven't had anything to eat to-day, but we at least have room
enough to stretch our wings."</p>
<p>"Why, that is a fact," clucked the brown hen. And all the
feathered family&mdash;even the smallest chickens&mdash;stretched
their wings, and looked a little more cheerful.</p>
<p>"Now, then," went on the rooster, "suppose we have a little
music to cheer us and help pass the hours until roosting time. Let
us all crow. There, I beg your pardon, ladies; I am sorry you can't
crow. Let us sing a happy song. Will you be kind enough to start a
merry tune, Mrs. Brown Hen?"</p>
<p>The brown hen shook herself proudly, tossed her head back and
began,&mdash;"Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca!" In less than two minutes every
one in the henhouse had joined her. The white <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>{104}</span> rooster
was the loudest of all, and the little bantam rooster stretched his
neck and did the best he could.</p>
<p>Now, the horses, cows, and sheep were not far away. They heard
the happy voices, and they, too, joined in the grand chorus. The
pigs did their best to sing louder than all the rest.</p>
<p>Higher and higher, stronger and stronger, rose the chorus.
Louder and louder quacked the ducks. Shriller and shriller squealed
the pigs.</p>
<p>They were all so happy that they quite forgot their hunger until
the door of the henhouse burst open, and in came three chubby
children. Each was carrying a dish of hot chicken food.</p>
<p>"Don't stop your music, Mr. Rooster," said the little girl, who
was bundled up until you could scarcely see her dear little
face.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig105.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig105.jpg" alt=
"The children arrive with food" /></a></div>
<p>"You see, we were so lonesome that we didn't know what to do. We
heard you folk singing out here, and we laughed and laughed until
we almost cried. Then we went to tell <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>{105}</span> Jack
about you. He was lonesome, too, for he's sick with a sore throat,
you know. He said, 'Why, those poor hens! They haven't been fed
since morning! Go and feed them.' And so we came."</p>
<p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" said the white rooster. "This comes of
making the best of things. Cock-a-doodle-doo!" And nobody asked him
to stop crowing.</p>

<h2><a name="mirror" id="mirror">THE ANIMALS AND THE
MIRROR</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Aunt Susan sent an old-fashioned looking-glass to the barn to be
stored in the loft, with other old furniture. The farm boy stood it
on the floor of the barn until he should have time to put it away.
The mirror was broad and long, and it was set in a dark wooden
frame.</p>
<p>An old duck wandered into the barn and caught sight of herself
in the mirror. "There is another duck," she said. "I wonder who she
is."</p>
<p>And she walked toward the reflection. "She is rather friendly,"
the duck went on. "She is walking toward me. What large feet she
has, but her feathers are very handsome."</p>
<p>Just then she bumped into the mirror. "Goodness!" she cried; "if
that duck isn't in a glass case! Why are you in there?"</p>
<p>"Well, you needn't answer if you don't <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> want to,"
she said, walking away. "A glass case is a good place for you."</p>
<p>Just then a pig came along, and nosing around, he came in front
of the mirror.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, thinking he saw another
pig. His nose hit the glass, and he stepped back.</p>
<p>"So you are in a glass pen," he said. "You are not very
handsome, and your nose is not so long as mine; I cannot see why
you should have a glass pen."</p>
<p>And away he trotted to tell the other pigs about the very
plain-looking pig.</p>
<p>Kitty came along next and walked in front of the mirror, turning
her head and swinging her tail. She had seen a mirror before and
knew what it was. The cat wished to look in the mirror, but she saw
the dog coming in the door, and she did not want him to think her
vain.</p>
<p>The dog walked over to the mirror and gazed in it. Then he
looked foolish, although he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
id="page108"></a>{108}</span> had seen a mirror before, too, but
not so often as puss.</p>
<p>"Thought it was another dog, didn't you?" she laughed. "Here
comes the donkey. Let us hide behind those barrels and see what he
does."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The donkey went up to the mirror.</p>
<p>"If they haven't another donkey!" he said. "I suppose I should
speak first, as I have lived here so long. Why, he is coming to
meet me. That is friendly, indeed."</p>
<p>Bump! his nose hit the glass.</p>
<p>"Well, I had better give up!" he said. "You are in a glass case,
but I don't know why you should be. You are a homely creature, and
your ears are not so long as mine." And he walked off with a
disgusted air.</p>
<p>The cat rolled over and over, and the dog buried his head in his
paws. "Did you ever see anything so funny?" he said to puss.</p>
<p>"Hush!" she replied, "Here is the rooster."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
"page109"></a>{109}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig109.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig109.jpg" alt=
"The rooster and the mirror" /></a></div>
<p>The rooster stopped quite still when he saw himself in the
mirror.</p>
<p>"Well, where did you come from?" he asked, ruffling up his
feathers. He walked straight to the mirror and flew at the other
rooster. Bang! He went against the glass.</p>
<p>"In a glass case, are you?" he said. He <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> stretched
out his neck and looked very fierce. "You should be; you are a
sight&mdash;your feathers are ruffled, and you are not half so
handsome as I am."</p>
<p>And off he walked, satisfied that he was handsomer than the
other rooster.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear!" laughed the cat. "I certainly shall scream. They all
think they are handsomer than their reflections. Here comes the
turkey gobbler. Let us see what he does."</p>
<p>The gobbler walked slowly over to the mirror and looked at his
reflection.</p>
<p>"Now," he asked, "where in the world did they get you? You are
an old, bald-headed creature, and your feathers need oiling. You
look like a last year's turkey." And off he strutted.</p>
<p>The cat and the dog leaned against the barrels and laughed until
the tears ran down their faces.</p>
<p>"Keep still," said the dog. "Here comes speckled hen and her
chickens."</p>
<p>Speckled hen walked around, picking up <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span> bits of
corn. Suddenly she looked up and saw the mirror.</p>
<p>"There is a hen with a brood of chicks, but they are not so
handsome as mine," she said, walking toward the looking-glass.
"Where do you live? I know you do not belong here." And she looked
closer at the other hen.</p>
<p>Click! Her bill hit the glass.</p>
<p>"Well, if she isn't in a glass coop!" the hen said, stepping
back. "If master has bought her and those chicks, there will be
trouble. Mercy! One of the chicks is bow-legged, and they are a
skinny looking lot."</p>
<p>Then she clucked to her chicks and walked out of the barn.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" laughed the dog; "they all think the same.
They certainly are a conceited lot. Here comes the goose."</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The goose waddled over to the mirror.</p>
<p>"Well, well! If there isn't a new goose!" <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> she said,
"and she is walking toward me. I must be friendly."</p>
<p>Snap! Her bill struck the mirror.</p>
<p>"Oh, you are in a glass box!" she said. "Have you come to stay?"
And she stretched out her neck.</p>
<p>"My, but you have a long neck!" she went on, "and your feathers
are nice and smooth. I suppose you cannot hear in that box."</p>
<p>Then she walked away, nodding good-by. The other goose, of
course, nodded also, and goosey went away satisfied.</p>
<p>"She is not so much of a goose as the others," the cat
remarked.</p>
<p>"The peacock is coming," said the dog. "Keep quiet."</p>
<p>In walked the peacock. Seeing another bird, as he supposed, he
spread his beautiful tail to its full width. He walked about, but
never a word did he say.</p>
<p>"Now, what do you make out of that?" asked the dog. "Did he know
that he was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id=
"page113"></a>{113}</span> looking in a looking-glass, or wouldn't
he speak to another bird?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," said the cat, "but here comes the goat. Hide,
quick!"</p>
<p>Billy was clattering over the boards, when suddenly he saw the
other goat. He looked at him a minute. "I'll show him," he said,
running at the mirror with head down.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig113.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig113.jpg" alt=
"The goat crashes into the mirror" /></a></div>
<p>Bang! Smash! Crash! and Billy jumped back, a very much
astonished goat.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id=
"page114"></a>{114}</span>
<p>"Now you have done it," said the horse, who had been watching
all the time from his stall. "All the animals will get out and run
away."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" said the dog, who was laughing so
hard he could scarcely talk. "There are no animals in there. That
is a looking-glass; you see yourself when you are in front of
it."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that those animals have all been looking
at themselves and finding fault with their own looks?" asked the
horse, with his eyes nearly popping out of his head.</p>
<p>"Of course," said the cat. "Can't you see that Billy has smashed
the looking-glass?"</p>
<p>"Well, that is the best I ever heard," said the horse, laughing,
"but I wish I had known that was a looking-glass before Billy broke
it. I should very much like to know how I look."</p>
<p>"You might not have recognized yourself; the others didn't,"
said the dog.</p>

<h2><a name="barber" id="barber">THE BARBER OF BAGDAD</a></h2>
<h3>ACT I</h3>
<p>PLACE: Ali's barber shop.</p>
<p>TIME: Morning.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: I have a load of wood which I have just brought in
on my donkey. Would you like to buy it, good barber?</p>
<p>ALI: Well, let me see. Is it good wood?</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: The best in the country.</p>
<p>ALI: I'll give you five shekels for all the wood upon the
donkey.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Agreed. I'll put the wood here by your door.</p>
<p>(Lays wood at door.)</p>
<p>Now, good sir, give me the silver.</p>
<p>ALI: Not so fast, my good friend. I must have your wooden pack
saddle, too. That was the bargain. I said, "All the wood upon your
donkey." Truly, the saddle is wood.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=

"Ali and the woodcutter with the donkey" /></a></div>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Who ever heard of such a bargain? Surely you cannot
mean what you say? You would not treat a poor woodcutter so. It is
impossible.</p>
<p>ALI: Give me the saddle, or I'll have you put in prison. And
take that&mdash;and that&mdash;and that!</p>
<p>(Ali strikes the woodcutter.)</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Ah, me, what shall I do? What shall I do? I know.
I'll go to the caliph himself.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
"page117"></a>{117}</span>
<h3>ACT II</h3>
<p>PLACE: Caliph's Palace.</p>
<p>TIME: Hour later.</p>
<p>COURTIER: My lord, a good woodcutter is at the door and begs
leave to come into your presence.</p>
<p>CALIPH: Bid him enter. There is none too poor to be received by
me.</p>
<p>(Courtier goes out and returns with woodcutter, who kneels and
kisses the ground. Then he stands with arms folded.)</p>
<p>CALIPH: Tell me, good man, what brought you here? Has any one
done you a wrong?</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Great wrong, my lord. The rich barber Ali did buy a
load of wood from me. He offered me five shekels for all the wood
on my donkey. When I had put down the load, I asked for my money,
but he refused to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id=
"page118"></a>{118}</span> pay me until I had given him my pack
saddle. He said the bargain was "all the wood on the donkey," and
that the saddle is wood. He said he would put me in prison if I did
not give up the saddle. Then he took it and drove me away with
blows.</p>
<p>CALIPH: A strange story, truly. The barber has law on his side,
and yet you have right on yours. The law must be obeyed,
but&mdash;come here and let me whisper something to you.</p>
<p>(The woodcutter listens smilingly and bowing low, leaves the
room.)</p>
<h3>ACT III</h3>
<p>PLACE: The barber's shop.</p>
<p>TIME: A few days later.</p>
<p>ALI: Ah! here comes my stupid friend the woodcutter. I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id=
"page119"></a>{119}</span> he has come to quarrel about the wood.
No, he is smiling.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Good day to you, friend Ali. I have come to ask if
you will be so kind as to shave me and a companion from the
country.</p>
<p>ALI: Oh, yes, I suppose so.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: How much will you charge?</p>
<p>ALI: A shekel for the two.</p>
<p>(To himself.)</p>
<p>The poor fool cannot pay that sum.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER. Very good. Shave me first.</p>
<p>(Ali shaves him.)</p>
<p>ALI: Now you are shaved. Where is your companion?</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: He is standing outside. He will come in at once.</p>
<p>(He goes out and returns leading his donkey.)</p>
<p>This is my companion. Shave him.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id=
"page120"></a>{120}</span>
<p>ALI (<i>in a rage</i>): Shave him! Shave a donkey, indeed! Is it
not enough that I should lower myself by touching you? And then you
insult me by asking me to shave your donkey! Away with you!</p>
<h3>ACT IV</h3>
<p>PLACE: Caliph's Palace.</p>
<p>TIME: Half-hour later.</p>
<p>CALIPH: Well, my friend, did you do as I told you?</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Yes, and Ali refused to shave my donkey.</p>
<p>CALIPH (<i>to Courtier</i>): Bid Ali come to me at once and
bring his razors with him.</p>
<p>(Courtier leaves and returns with Ali.)</p>
<p>CALIPH: Why did you refuse to shave this man's companion? Was
not that your agreement?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id=
"page121"></a>{121}</span>
<p>ALI (<i>kissing the ground</i>): It is true, O caliph, such was
the agreement, but who ever made a companion of a donkey
before?</p>
<p>CALIPH: True enough, but who ever thought of saying that a pack
saddle is a part of a load of wood? No, no, it is the woodcutter's
turn now. Shave his donkey instantly.</p>
<p>(Ali lathers the beast and shaves him in the presence of the
whole court, and then slips away amid the laughter of the
bystanders.)</p>
<p>CALIPH: Now, my honest woodcutter, here is a purse of gold for
you. Always remember that the caliph gladly listens to the
complaints of his people, poor and rich, and will right their
wrongs if he can.</p>
<p>WOODCUTTER: Long live the Caliph!</p>

<h2><a name="doll" id="doll">HOPE'S DOLL</a></h2>
<p>It was Saturday morning. Elizabeth Brown sat by a window in the
big kitchen making a pink dress for little Hope's doll.</p>
<p>On the chair beside her lay the doll, though you might not have
thought of calling it one. It did not have curly hair&mdash;nor
eyes that open and shut. In those days no child had toys like ours.
Hope's doll was made of a corncob; the face was painted on a piece
of linen stretched over a ball of wool on the end of the cob.</p>
<p>Little Hope was taking her morning nap. When Elizabeth had sewed
the last neat stitches, she dressed the doll and laid it on the bed
by the little girl. How happy Hope was when she awoke and saw it!
She thought it the most beautiful doll in the world.</p>
<p>"What will you call your doll, Hope?" asked Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"I will name her for mother," said Hope. "I will call her Mary
Ellen."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id=
"page124"></a>{124}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig124.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig124.jpg" alt=
"Hope and her doll" /></a></div>
<p>Hope played all the afternoon with her doll and was very happy.
When the sunset gun sounded, she had to stop playing. With the
Puritans, the Sabbath began at sunset, and no child could play
after the gun was heard.</p>
<p>The little maid kissed her baby and went into the bedroom to
find a warm place for it to stay until the next evening. There lay
father's Sunday coat; what warmer nest could she find for Mary
Ellen than its big pocket?</p>
<p>After breakfast the next day, every one got ready to go to
meeting. Master Brown filled the little tin foot stove with hot
coals from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span> hearth; then he took his gun from its
hook. In those days no man went anywhere without his gun&mdash;not
even to church, for the Indians were likely to come at any
time.</p>
<p>Sometimes the firing of a gun was the call to worship. More
often a big drum, beaten on the steps of the meeting house, told
the people it was time to come together.</p>
<p>At the sound of the drum, Master Brown and his wife, with
Elizabeth and Hope, started to church. From every house in the
village came men, women, and children. They were always ready when
the drum began to beat, for no one was ever late to meeting in
those days.</p>
<p>Master Brown led his family to their pew and opened a little
door to let them in. The pew was very much like a large box with
seats around the sides.</p>
<p>The church was cold, for there was no fire. The children warmed
their fingers and toes by the queer little foot stove their father
had brought from home.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
"page126"></a>{126}</span>
<p>When every one was seated, the minister climbed the steps to his
high pulpit. The sermon was always very long&mdash;three hours at
least. The children could not understand what it was all about, and
it was very hard for them to sit still and listen quietly.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was four years older than Hope, so she felt quite like
a little woman. She sat up beside her mother and looked at the
minister almost all the time; but sometimes she had to wink hard to
keep awake. When she thought she could not let her feet hang down
another minute, she would slip down to the footstool to rest.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was often ashamed of Hope, who could not sit still ten
minutes. She tried to listen to the sermon, but could not. When she
began to stir about a little, her mother shook her head at her. She
sat still for a few minutes, but was soon restless again.</p>
<p>Presently she began to be sleepy and laid her head upon her
father's arm for a nap. Just then she felt something in his pocket.
A <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id=
"page127"></a>{127}</span> happy smile came over Hope's face; she
was wide-awake now. Slipping her hand into the wide pocket, she
drew out Mary Ellen and smoothed her wrinkled gown.</p>
<p>Master Brown's thoughts were all on the sermon, and even
Mistress Brown did not notice Hope for a little time. When she did,
what do you suppose she saw? Hope was standing on the seat showing
her doll to the little girl in the pew behind her.</p>
<p>Oh, how ashamed her mother was! She pulled her little daughter
down quickly and whispered, "Do you want the tithingman to come?
Well, sit down and listen." Taking Mary Ellen, she slipped the doll
into her muff.</p>
<p>Little Hope did sit down and listen. She did not even turn
around when the kind lady behind them dropped a peppermint over the
high-backed pew for her. She was very much afraid of the
tithingman, who sat on a high seat. He had a long rod with a hard
knob on one end and a squirrel's tail on the other.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id=
"page128"></a>{128}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig128.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig128.jpg" alt=
"The tithingman tickling the nodding lady" /></a></div>
<p>When he saw a lady nodding during the sermon, he stepped around
to her pew and tickled her face with the fur end of the rod. She
would waken with a start and be, oh! so ashamed. She would be very
glad the pew had such high sides to hide her blushing face.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think the boys who sat on the other side of the
church had a good time. But there was the tithingman again. When he
saw a boy whispering or playing, he rapped him on the head with the
knob end of the rod. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
id="page129"></a>{129}</span> whispering would stop at once, for
the rod often brought tears and left a headache.</p>
<p>Besides keeping the boys from playing and the grown people from
going to sleep, the tithingman must turn the hourglass. In those
days very few people could afford clocks, but every one had an
hourglass. It took the fine sand just one hour to pour from the
upper part of the glass into the lower part.</p>
<p>When the sand had all run through, the tithingman turned the
glass over and the sand began to tell another hour. The glass was
always turned three times before the minister closed the service.
Then the men picked up their muskets and foot stoves, the women
wrapped their long capes closely about them, and all went home.</p>
<p>At sunset the Puritan Sabbath ended. The women brought out their
knitting and spinning, or prepared for Monday's washing, and the
children were free to play until bedtime.</p>

<h2><a name="nahum" id="nahum">NAHUM PRINCE</a></h2>
<p>More than a hundred years ago, our country was at war with
England. George Washington was at the head of our army. As you
know, he and his men were fighting for our country's freedom.</p>
<p>The English army was larger than our army, and General
Washington needed all the men he could get. The regular troops were
with him.</p>
<p>In one little town in Vermont all the strong, able-bodied men
had gone to the front. News came that the English and the Americans
were about to meet in battle. The Americans needed more men and
called for volunteers. Old men with white hair and long beards
volunteered. Young boys with smooth cheeks and unshaven lips
volunteered. There wasn't a boy in the village over thirteen years
of age who didn't volunteer.</p>
<p>Even lame Nahum Prince offered himself. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>{131}</span> He
brought out his grandfather's old gun and got in line with the
others. He stood as straight and tall as he could&mdash;as a
soldier should stand.</p>
<p>Soon the captain came along the line to inspect the volunteers.
When he saw Nahum, he said, "No, no, Nahum, you cannot go; you know
you cannot. Why, you could not walk a mile. Go home, my lad."</p>
<p>Just then the good old minister came by. "Yes, Nahum," he said,
"you must stay at home. Who knows but that you will find a greater
work to do for your country right here?"</p>
<p>And lame Nahum dropped out of the line.</p>
<p>Then the volunteers marched off, every man and boy in the
village except Nahum Prince. Poor Nahum! His heart was heavy.</p>
<p>"What can I do for my country in this small village?" he said to
himself. "Oh, I wish I could be a soldier!"</p>
<p>He walked toward his home slowly and sadly. Just as he passed
the blacksmith shop, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id=
"page132"></a>{132}</span> three horseman galloped up to the
door.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig132.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig132.jpg" alt=
"The horseman speaks to Nahum" /></a></div>
<p>"Where is the blacksmith?" asked one.</p>
<p>"He and all the men and boys have gone to join the army," said
Nahum. "There isn't a man or a boy in town except me. I wouldn't be
here if I were not lame."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id=
"page133"></a>{133}</span>
<p>"We cannot have this horse shod," said the rider to the others.
"We shall not reach there in time."</p>
<p>"Why, I can set a shoe," said Nahum.</p>
<p>"Then it is lucky you are left behind," said the man. "Light up
the forge and set the shoe."</p>
<p>Nahum lighted the fire, blew the coals with the bellows, and
soon put on the shoe.</p>
<p>"You have done a great deed to-day, my boy," said the rider as
he thanked Nahum and rode away.</p>
<p>The next week the boys came home and told of a great battle.
They told how the Americans were about to lose the fight when
Colonel Seth Warner, leading a band of soldiers, rode up just in
time to save the day.</p>
<p>Nahum said nothing, but he knew that Colonel Warner would not
have arrived in time if he had not set that shoe. And it was really
Nahum Prince and Colonel Seth Warner who won the victory of
Bennington.</p>

<h2><a name="little-cook" id="little-cook">THE LITTLE COOK'S
REWARD</a></h2>
<p>Betty lived a long, long time ago on a farm in North Carolina.
She knew how to clean up the house, to wash the dishes, to sew, and
to cook. She knew how to knit, and to spin and weave, too.</p>
<p>One day Betty's father said, "Let us go to town to-morrow.
President Washington is passing through the South, and a man told
me to-day that he will be in Salisbury to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Betty's brother Robert, "and our company has been
asked to march in the parade. One of the boys is going to make a
speech of welcome."</p>
<p>"I should like to go," said their mother, "but I can't leave
home."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you can, mother," said Betty. "I have stayed here by
myself many times, and I can stay to-morrow. You go with father,
and I will take care of things."</p>
<p>The next morning every one on the place was <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> up before
the sun. Robert was so impatient to start to town that he could
scarcely eat any breakfast. Mother was so excited that she forgot
to put coffee in the coffee pot.</p>
<p>At last every one had left, and Betty was alone. "I wish I could
see the President," she said, "and I do wish I could see his great
coach. Father says that it is finer than the Governor's. Four men
ride in front of it, and four behind it. The servants are dressed
in white and gold. How I wish I could see it all!"</p>
<p>While Betty was talking to herself, she was not idle. She washed
the dishes and she cleaned the house. Then, as it was not time to
get dinner, she sat down on the shady porch.</p>
<p>"I wonder whether General Washington looks like his picture,"
she said. "Oh, if I could only see him!"</p>
<p>But what sound was that? Betty stood up, and shading her eyes
with her hands, looked down the road. Four horsemen came along at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id=
"page136"></a>{136}</span> a gallop. Then there followed a great
white coach, trimmed with gold and drawn by four white horses.
There were four horsemen behind the coach, and last of all came
several black servants.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig136.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig136.jpg" alt=
"Betty looking up at the great coach" /></a></div>
<p>All stopped at the gate. A tall handsome man stepped from the
coach and came up the walk. Betty felt as if she could neither move
nor speak. She remembered, however, all that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>{137}</span> her
mother had taught her, and she made a low curtsy as the gentleman
reached the steps.</p>
<p>"Good morning, my little maid," he said. "I know it is late, but
would you give an old man some breakfast?"</p>
<p>Betty's cheeks grew as pink as the rose by the porch. She made
another curtsy and said, "Indeed, I will. I am the only one at
home, for father, mother, and Robert have gone to Salisbury to see
the great Washington. But I am sure I can give you some breakfast.
Father says that I am a good cook."</p>
<p>"I know you are, and that you are as brisk as you are pretty.
Just give me a breakfast, and I promise you that you shall see
Washington before your father, mother, or brother Robert does."</p>
<p>"I will do the best I can, sir," Betty said.</p>
<p>The other men came in, and all sat on the porch and talked while
Betty worked. Getting her mother's whitest cloth and the silver
that came from England, she quickly set the table. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> She
brought out a loaf of new bread and a jar of fresh honey. Then she
ran to the spring house and got yellow butter and rich milk. She
had some fresh eggs that had been laid by her own hens. These she
dropped into boiling water. Last of all she cut thin slices of
delicious ham.</p>
<p>When everything was ready, Betty went to the porch and invited
the strangers in. Her cheeks were now the color of the red rose by
the gate.</p>
<p>The visitors ate heartily of all the good things Betty had
prepared. As the tall, handsome gentleman rose to go, he leaned
over and kissed her. "My pretty little cook," he said, "you may
tell your brother Robert that you saw Washington before he did, and
that he kissed you, too."</p>
<p>You may believe that Betty did tell it. She told it to her
children, and they told it to their children, and I am telling it
to you to-day.</p>

<h2><a name="tar-wolf" id="tar-wolf">THE TAR WOLF</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Many hundreds of moons ago, there was a great drought. The
streams and lakes were drying up. Water was so scarce that the
animals held a council to decide what they should do.</p>
<p>"I hope it will rain soon and fill the streams and lakes," Great
Bear said. "If it does not, all the animals will have to go to a
land where there is more water."</p>
<p>"I know where there is plenty of water," said Wild Goose.</p>
<p>"I do, too," said Wild Duck.</p>
<p>Most of the animals did not wish to go away. "It is well enough
for the ducks and geese to go," said Wild Cat; "they like to move
about. It is well enough for Great Bear to go; he can sleep through
the winter in one hollow tree as soundly as in another. But we do
not wish to leave our hunting grounds."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id=
"page141"></a>{141}</span>
<p>"If we go to a new country," said Gray Wolf, "we shall have to
make new trails."</p>
<p>"And we shall have to clear new land," said Big Beaver, who had
to cut down the trees when land was cleared.</p>
<p>All this time the Rabbit said nothing. "Brother Rabbit," Great
Bear asked, "what do you think about this matter?"</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit did not answer. His eyes were shut, and he seemed
too sleepy to think about anything.</p>
<p>Great Bear asked again, "What do you think about it, Brother
Rabbit? Shall we go to the place the ducks and geese have found,
where there is plenty of water?"</p>
<p>"Oh," answered Brother Rabbit, "I do not mind the drought. I
drink the dew on the grass in the early morning; I do not need to
go where there is more water."</p>
<p>And he shut his eyes again.</p>
<p>"Well," said Red Deer, "if there is dew enough for Brother
Rabbit every morning, there <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
id="page142"></a>{142}</span> is dew enough for us. We need not go
to another country."</p>
<p>"Those are wise words, my brother," said Brown Terrapin.</p>
<p>All the others said, "Those are wise words, my brother," and the
council was over. The animals were happy because they thought they
need not go away from their homes.</p>
<p>Days passed, and still it did not rain. The animals found that
the dew did not keep them from suffering from thirst. They were
afraid that, after all, they would have to go to another
country.</p>
<p>Still the Rabbit looked sleek and fat. He declared that he got
all the water he needed from the dew on the grass in the early
morning.</p>
<p>"You sleep too late," he said. "By the time you get up, the sun
has dried the dew."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>After that, the animals came out earlier than before, but they
could not get water enough <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
id="page143"></a>{143}</span> from the morning dew. They did not
understand why the Rabbit looked so well.</p>
<p>One day Gray Wolf said to Wild Cat, "Let us watch the Rabbit and
see where he gets so much dew that he is never thirsty."</p>
<p>That night they stayed in the woods near Rabbit's wigwam, so as
to follow him on the trail. They kept awake all night for fear that
they might sleep too late.</p>
<p>Very early in the morning, Brother Rabbit came out of his wigwam
and ran swiftly down the hill. Wild Cat and Gray Wolf followed as
fast and as quietly as they could.</p>
<p>The dew was on the grass and leaves, but Brother Rabbit did not
stop to get it. Instead, he ran down the hill and pushed away a
heap of brush. Wild Cat and Gray Wolf hid behind some bushes and
watched him.</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit drank from a little spring. Then he filled a jar
with clear, fresh water, piled the brush over the spring again, and
went up the hill to his wigwam.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id=
"page144"></a>{144}</span>
<p>Ah! now Gray Wolf and Wild Cat knew why Brother Rabbit did not
mind the drought; and they made a plan to punish him for being so
selfish.</p>
<p>They got tar and resin from the pine trees, and out of these
they made a great wolf. After placing it close to the spring, they
hid again in the bushes, to see what would happen.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, Brother Rabbit came running down the
hill for more water. He stopped when he saw the tar wolf by his
spring.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Gray Wolf?" he asked. Of course there
was no answer.</p>
<p>"Has my brother no ears?" asked Brother Rabbit.</p>
<p>As the wolf was still silent, Brother Rabbit became angry.
"Answer me, Gray Wolf," he cried. But there was no answer.</p>
<p>Then Brother Rabbit slapped the tar wolf with his right front
paw. It stuck fast, and Brother Rabbit could not pull it away.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id=
"page145"></a>{145}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig145.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig145.jpg" alt=
"Brother Rabbit and the wolf" /></a></div>
<p>"Let me go," he cried, "or I will slap you with the other
paw."</p>
<p>He slapped the tar wolf with the left front paw. That too, stuck
fast.</p>
<p>Now Brother Rabbit was very angry. "Let me go, Gray Wolf," he
cried. "Let me go, I say!"</p>
<p>As Grey Wolf did not let him go, Brother <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> Rabbit
kicked the tar wolf, first with one of his hind paws and then with
the other. Both stuck fast, and so he was held by all four
paws.</p>
<p>Just then Gray Wolf and Wild Cat came from their hiding
place.</p>
<p>"We have caught you, Brother Rabbit," they said. "Now we are
going to take you to the council and tell how you tried to keep all
the water for yourself."</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>They took Brother Rabbit to the council house, and sent for
Great Bear and all the other animals. Soon all came, and the
council began. Gray Wolf told that he had seen Brother Rabbit go to
the spring, uncover it, get water, and cover the spring up
again.</p>
<p>The animals said that Brother Rabbit must be punished, but how
they could not decide.</p>
<p>"Burn him alive," said Gray Wolf.</p>
<p>"I am quite willing," Brother Rabbit said, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> smiling.
"Fire is my friend and will not hurt me."</p>
<p>"We might cut off his head," said Brown Terrapin.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the Rabbit, quietly. "Try that. It will not
hurt me, for a better head will grow back."</p>
<p>He said he was not afraid of each thing that was mentioned.</p>
<p>"Is there nothing of which you are afraid?" asked Great Bear, at
last. "Is there nothing that can hurt you?"</p>
<p>"Of only one thing am I afraid," answered Brother Rabbit, in a
low voice. "I am afraid you will turn me loose in the brier patch.
Please do not throw me in the brier patch."</p>
<p>"Turn him loose in the brier patch!" cried all the animals.</p>
<p>How frightened Brother Rabbit looked now!</p>
<p>"Oh, Gray Wolf," he begged, "burn me; cut off my head. Do
anything else with me, but please don't throw me in the brier
patch."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id=
"page148"></a>{148}</span>
<p>The more he begged, the faster Gray Wolf hurried to the brier
patch. The other animals followed close behind. They were all
talking about the tricks Brother Rabbit had played on them and how
they had never before been able to get even with him.</p>
<p>When they came to the edge of the brier patch, Brother Rabbit
begged harder than ever.</p>
<p>"Good Wolf," he cried, "do anything else with me, but don't
throw me in the brier patch!"</p>
<p>Gray Wolf laughed and threw Brother Rabbit far into the
patch.</p>
<p>Brother Rabbit landed on his feet, and off he ran through the
briers. He called back, "Thank you, good Wolf! You threw me right
on my trail! I was born and bred in the brier patch. I was born and
bred in the brier patch!"</p>
<p>He was running so fast that by the time he said this, he was out
of sight.</p>

<h2><a name="rabbit-wolf" id="rabbit-wolf">THE RABBIT AND THE
WOLF</a></h2>
<p>The rabbit liked to play tricks on the other animals. Best of
all, he liked to play tricks on the wolf. At last the wolf grew
angry and said that he was going to get even with the rabbit.</p>
<p>One day he caught the rabbit coming through a field.</p>
<p>"Now," said the wolf, "I am going to pay you for all the tricks
you have played on me. I will cut off your ears and use them for
spoons to stir my hominy pot. As soon as I sharpen this stone, off
your ears go!"</p>
<p>While the wolf sharpened the stone, he sang in his harsh voice a
song somewhat like this:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Watch me sharpen,</p>
<p>Watch me sharpen;</p>
<p>Soon I am going to cut off your ears.</p>
<p>Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,</p>
<p>Sicum, se mi su!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id=
"page150"></a>{150}</span>
<p>When he sang,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,</p>
<p>Sicum, se mi su!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the rabbit could almost feel the sharp stone cutting his ears.
But he was a brave little rabbit and said nothing.</p>
<p>At last the wolf stopped singing for a moment.</p>
<p>Then the rabbit said, "Brother Wolf, I know a new dance. Don't
you wish me to teach it to you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when I have cut off your ears," said the wolf.</p>
<p>Then he went on singing,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sicum, sicum, sicum, sicum,</p>
<p>Sicum, se mi su!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"After my ears are cut off," said the rabbit, "I can never dance
any more."</p>
<p>Now the wolf knew that the rabbit could sing and dance better
than any other animal, and he wished very much to learn the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id=
"page151"></a>{151}</span> dance. He went on sharpening the stone,
but he did not sing while he worked.</p>
<p>After a while he asked, "Is the new dance as pretty as the Snake
Dance?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a great deal prettier," answered the rabbit.</p>
<p>"Is it as pretty as the Turkey Dance?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a great deal prettier than the Turkey Dance."</p>
<p>"Is it as pretty as the Eagle Dance?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a great deal prettier than the Eagle Dance."</p>
<p>The wolf asked if the new dance was as pretty as other dances he
had seen, and the rabbit said that it was much prettier.</p>
<p>This pleased the wolf, as he wished to have a new dance for the
green corn festival.</p>
<p>"You may teach me the dance now," he said. "I can cut off your
ears afterward."</p>
<p>"Very well," said the rabbit; "pat your foot to keep time, and
watch me while I dance."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id=

<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig152.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig152.jpg" alt=
"The rabbit danced as the wolf shook the rattle" /></a></div>
<p>So the wolf stood in the middle of the field, patting his foot
and shaking a rattle while the rabbit danced around him and
sang,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Watch me dance around the field,</p>
<p>Watch me dance around the field,</p>
<p class="i4">Hi, la, hi, la, hi!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then the rabbit made a ring in the middle of the field. He said
to the wolf, "Now, you dance around this ring, and sing just as I
do."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id=
"page153"></a>{153}</span>
<p>He made a larger ring for himself and danced around just beyond
the wolf. The wolf thought that this was the finest dance he had
ever seen. He and the rabbit danced faster and faster, and sang
louder and louder.</p>
<p>As the rabbit danced, he moved nearer and nearer to the edge of
the field. The wolf was dancing so fast and singing so loud that he
did not notice this.</p>
<p>The rabbit kept on singing,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Now I dance on the edge of the field,</p>
<p>Now I dance on the edge of the field,</p>
<p>Hi, la, hi, la, hi!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At last, Brother Rabbit reached the edge of the field; then he
jumped into the blackberry bushes and ran away. The wolf tried to
give chase, but he was so dizzy that he could not run. And the
rabbit got away without having his ears cut off.</p>

<h2><a name="fiddle" id="fiddle">THE MONKEY'S FIDDLE</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Once upon a time there was a great famine in the land, and
Monkey could find no food. There were no bulbs, no beans, no
insects, nor anything else to eat.</p>
<p>At last Monkey said to himself, "Why should I perish here with
hunger? My uncle Orang-outang has enough and to spare; I shall go
to him, and he will give me food and shelter."</p>
<p>So he set out and soon came to the place where Orang-outang
lived. For a long time Monkey was happy in his new home, but by and
by he heard that there was no longer a famine in his own land. Then
he decided to go back.</p>
<p>Before he started, Orang-outang made him a present of a fiddle
and of a bow and arrow,</p>
<p>"With this bow and arrow you can kill any animal," he said.
"With this fiddle you can make anything dance until you bid it
stop."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id=
"page157"></a>{157}</span>
<p>Thanking his uncle for the presents, Monkey set out on his
homeward journey. On the way he met Brother Wolf.</p>
<p>"What news, Brother Wolf?" asked Monkey.</p>
<p>When Wolf had told him the news, Monkey asked, "What have you
been doing to-day?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said Wolf, "I have been following a deer all the morning,
but I have been unable to get near enough to kill him. Now I am
faint with hunger."</p>
<p>"I can help you," said Monkey. "I have a magic bow and arrow.
Show me the deer, and I will bring him down."</p>
<p>When Wolf showed him the deer, Monkey fitted an arrow to the bow
and took aim. Hardly had the arrow left the bow when the deer fell
dead.</p>
<p>Monkey and Wolf sat down and had a good feast. As Wolf ate, he
thought of the magic bow and arrow, and he planned to get them away
from Monkey.</p>
<p>"First I will ask for them," he said to himself. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>{158}</span> "If
Monkey will not give them to me, I will use force."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig158.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig158.jpg" alt=
"Wolf demands the bow and arrow" /></a></div>
<p>When Wolf had finished eating, he said to Monkey, "Please give
me the bow and arrow."</p>
<p>"I will not," said Monkey. "They were a present from my dear
uncle; why should I give them to you?"</p>
<p>"Very well," said Wolf. "I am stronger than you, and I will take
them by force."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id=
"page159"></a>{159}</span>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Wolf was just about to snatch the bow and arrow from Monkey when
Jackal came along. Then Wolf thought of a new plan.</p>
<p>He called out to Jackal, "Help! help! Monkey has stolen my magic
bow and arrow."</p>
<p>Jackal came running to them. Wolf told his side of the story,
and Monkey told his.</p>
<p>"I cannot believe either of you," said Jackal. "Let us lay the
question before the court. There Lion, Tiger, and the other animals
will hear you both; perhaps they will be able to decide to whom the
magic bow and arrow belong. But to keep you two from quarreling, I
had better take care of the bow and arrow."</p>
<p>Monkey gave them to Jackal, and all three started off to court.
When they arrived, there sat Lion on the throne. Seated around were
the other animals of the jungle.</p>
<p>Monkey told his story first. Standing in front of the throne, he
made a low bow and said, "The great famine, my lord, drove me out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id=
"page160"></a>{160}</span> of my country, and I had to take refuge
with my uncle. When I started back home, he gave me this bow and
arrow. Finding Wolf almost starving, I shot a deer for him. Instead
of being grateful for the food, he tried to rob me of the bow and
arrow. I am here to ask that you restore them to me."</p>
<p>"He does not tell the truth," cried Wolf.</p>
<p>Then Jackal said, "I believe that the bow and arrow belong to
Wolf; he and Monkey were quarreling about them when I came along.
They agreed to leave the question to you, King Lion. I know you
will see that justice is done."</p>
<p>Wolf looked very innocent and said nothing.</p>
<p>King Lion rose and asked, "What say you? To whom do the bow and
arrow belong?"</p>
<p>"To Wolf," they all cried.</p>
<p>"Stealing is a crime that must be punished," said King Lion.
"What shall be done?"</p>
<p>"Let Monkey be hanged," they all cried.</p>
<p>Monkey still had his magic fiddle. Holding it in his hand, he
made a deep bow and said: <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
id="page161"></a>{161}</span> "Give me leave to play a tune on my
fiddle before I hang, O King."</p>
<p>Now, the beasts all loved a merry tune, and knowing that Monkey
was a master player they called out, "Let him play."</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Monkey placed the fiddle under his chin, drew the bow across the
strings, and struck up "Cockcrow." This was a favorite tune with
the court. At the first notes all nodded their heads in time to the
music. As Monkey played on, the entire court began to dance.</p>
<p>Round and round they went like a whirlwind. Over and over,
quicker and quicker sounded the tune of "Cockcrow." Faster and
faster flew the dancers, until one after another fell to the ground
worn out.</p>
<p>Monkey saw nothing of all this. With eyes closed and his head
placed lovingly against the fiddle, he played on and on, keeping
time with his foot.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id=
"page162"></a>{162}</span>
<p>Wolf was the first one to cry out, "Please stop, Cousin Monkey.
For pity's sake, stop."</p>
<p>But Monkey did not seem to hear him. Again and again sounded the
magic notes of "Cockcrow."</p>
<p>King Lion had gone round and round with his young wife so many
times that both were ready to drop. At last, as he passed Monkey,
he roared, "Stop, ape! My whole kingdom is yours if you will only
stop playing."</p>
<p>"I do not want it," said Monkey. "Make Wolf confess that he
tried to steal my bow and arrow. Then I will stop playing."</p>
<p>"I confess! I confess!" panted Wolf, who was ready to fall to
the ground.</p>
<p>"Good," cried King Lion, as the music stopped. "Monkey is
innocent. Let him have his bow and arrow."</p>
<p>"Punish Wolf!" cried the animals.</p>
<p>So Wolf was soundly beaten and driven from the court. Then
Monkey went off rejoicing, carrying with him his magic gifts.</p>

<h2><a name="tasks" id="tasks">THE THREE TASKS</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>There were once two brothers who set out to seek their fortune.
They wasted their time and their money in all sorts of foolish
ways, and before long they were nearly penniless.</p>
<p>After the two brothers had been gone some time, their younger
brother, who had always been thought the simpleton of the family,
set out to seek his fortune.</p>
<p>One day as he was passing through a village far away from home,
he found his two brothers.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" they asked.</p>
<p>"I am going to seek my fortune," he replied.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha! how foolish you are!" they cried. "With all our wit and
wisdom we have been unable to make our fortune. It is silly of you
even to try." And they laughed and made fun of him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the three brothers decided to travel on together.
As they journeyed on, they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
id="page164"></a>{164}</span> saw a large ant hill by the side of
the road. The two elder brothers were about to destroy it, when the
simpleton said, "Leave the poor ants alone. I will not let you
disturb them."</p>
<p>They went on their way until they came to a pond upon which two
ducks were swimming. The two older brothers were about to kill
them, when the simpleton said, "Leave them alone. I will not let
you kill them."</p>
<p>Soon the three came to a tree, in the trunk of which was a wild
bee's nest. The two older brothers wished to steal the honey. They
started to make a fire under the tree and smoke out the bees. The
simpleton said, "Leave the poor bees alone. I will not let you rob
them."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>At last the three brothers came to a castle where everything
looked as if it had been turned to stone. There was not a single
human being to be seen. They walked along the great wide hall, but
still they saw no one.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id=
"page165"></a>{165}</span>
<p>"The castle must be enchanted," the brothers said to one
another.</p>
<p>After passing through many rooms, they came to a door in which
there were three locks. In the middle of the door was a little
grating through which they could look into the room beyond.</p>
<p>They saw a little man, dressed in gray, seated at a table. Twice
they called to him, but he did not answer. They called a third
time. Then he rose, opened the three locks, and came out.</p>
<p>He said not a word, but led them to a table on which a feast was
spread. When they had eaten and drunk as much as they wished, the
old man showed each of them to a bedroom. There they rested well
all night.</p>
<p>The next morning the little gray man came to the eldest brother
and beckoned him to follow. He led him to a room in which there was
a stone table, and on the table there lay three stone tablets.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id=
"page166"></a>{166}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig166.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig166.jpg" alt=
"The little gray man and the tablets" /></a></div>
<p>On the table near the tablets was written:</p>
<p>"This castle is enchanted. Before the enchantment can be broken,
there are three tasks to be performed. The one who performs these
three tasks shall marry the youngest and dearest of the three
princesses who now lie asleep in the castle."</p>
<p>When the eldest brother had read this, the old man gave him the
first tablet. On it was written:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id=
"page167"></a>{167}</span>
<p>"In the forest, hidden beneath the thick moss, are the pearls
which belonged to the princesses. They are a thousand in number.
These must be collected by sunset. If one single pearl is missing,
then he who has sought them shall be turned to stone."</p>
<p>The eldest brother searched the whole day long, but by sunset he
had found only a hundred pearls. So he was turned to stone.</p>
<p>The following day the second brother tried his luck, but by
sunset he had found but two hundred pearls. So he, too, was turned
to stone.</p>
<p>Then it came the simpleton's turn. He searched all day amidst
the moss, but he fared little better than his brothers. At last he
sat down upon a stone and burst into tears.</p>
<p>As he sat there, the king of the ants, whose life he had once
saved, came with five thousand ants. Before long the little
creatures had found every one of the pearls and piled them up in a
heap.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id=
"page168"></a>{168}</span>
<p>The little gray man then gave the simpleton the second tablet.
Upon it was written the second task:</p>
<p>"The key that opens the chamber in which the princesses are
sleeping lies in the bottom of the lake. He who has performed the
first task must find the key."</p>
<p>When the simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he had
saved were swimming upon it. At once they dived down into the
depths below and brought up the key.</p>
<p>The simpleton showed the key to the little gray man, who then
gave him the third tablet. On it was written the third task:</p>
<p>"The one who has gathered the pearls and found the key to the
chamber may now marry the youngest and dearest princess. He must,
however, first tell which is she. The princesses are exactly alike,
but there is one difference. Before they went to sleep, the eldest
ate sugar, the second ate syrup, and the youngest ate honey."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id=
"page169"></a>{169}</span>
<p>The simpleton laid down the tablet with a sigh. "How can I find
out which princess ate the honey?" he asked himself.</p>
<p>However, he put the key he had found in the lock and opened the
door. In the chamber the three princesses were lying. Ah, which was
the youngest?</p>
<p>Just then the queen of the bees flew in through the window and
tasted the lips of all three. When she came to the lips that had
sipped the honey, she remained there. Then the young man knew that
this was the youngest and dearest princess.</p>
<p>So the enchantment came to an end. The sleepers awoke, and those
who had been turned to stone became alive again. The simpleton
married the youngest and dearest princess, and was made king after
her father's death. His two brothers, who were now sorry for what
they had done, married the other two princesses, and lived happily
ever after.</p>

<h2><a name="sleeping-beauty" id="sleeping-beauty">THE SLEEPING
BEAUTY</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who were very
unhappy because they had no children. But at last a little daughter
was born, and their sorrow was turned to joy. All the bells in the
land were rung to tell the glad tidings.</p>
<p>The king gave a christening feast so grand that the like of it
had never been known. He invited all the fairies he could find in
the kingdom&mdash;there were seven of them&mdash;to come to the
christening as godmothers. He hoped that each would give the
princess a good gift.</p>
<p>When the christening was over, the feast came. Before each of
the fairies was placed a plate with a spoon, a knife, and a
fork&mdash;all pure gold. But alas! as the fairies were about to
seat themselves at the table, there came into the hall a very old
fairy who had not been invited. She had left the kingdom fifty
years <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id=
"page173"></a>{173}</span> before and had not been seen or heard of
until this day.</p>
<p>The king at once ordered that a plate should be brought for her,
but he could not furnish a gold one such as the others had. This
made the old fairy angry, and she sat there muttering to
herself.</p>
<p>Her angry threats were overheard by a young fairy who sat near.
This good godmother, fearing the old fairy might give the child an
unlucky gift, hid herself behind a curtain. She did this because
she wished to speak last and perhaps be able to change the old
fairy's gift.</p>
<p>At the end of the feast, the youngest fairy stepped forward and
said, "The princess shall be the most beautiful woman in the
world."</p>
<p>The second said,</p>
<p>"She shall have a temper as sweet as an angel."</p>
<p>The third said,</p>
<p>"She shall have a wonderful grace in all she does or says."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id=
"page174"></a>{174}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig174.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig174.jpg" alt=
"The old fairy looks at the princess in her cradle" /></a></div>
<p>The fourth said,</p>
<p>"She shall sing like a nightingale."</p>
<p>The fifth said,</p>
<p>"She shall dance like a flower in the wind."</p>
<p>The sixth said,</p>
<p>"She shall play such music as was never heard on earth."</p>
<p>Then the old fairy's turn came. Shaking her head spitefully, she
said,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id=
"page175"></a>{175}</span>
<p>"When the princess is seventeen years old, she shall prick her
finger with a spindle, and&mdash;she&mdash;shall&mdash;die!"</p>
<p>At this all the guests trembled, and many of them began to weep.
The king and queen wept loudest of all.</p>
<p>Just then the wise young fairy came from behind the curtain and
said: "Do not grieve, O King and Queen. Your daughter shall not
die. I cannot undo what my elder sister has done; the princess
shall indeed prick her finger with the spindle, but she shall not
die. She shall fall into sleep that will last a hundred years. At
the end of that time, a king's son will find her and awaken
her."</p>
<p>Immediately all the fairies vanished.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The king, hoping to save his child even from this misfortune,
commanded that all spindles should be burned. This was done, but it
was all in vain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id=
"page176"></a>{176}</span>
<p>One day when the princess was seventeen years of age, the king
and queen left her alone in the castle. She wandered about the
palace and at last came to a little room in the top of a tower.
There an old woman&mdash;so old and deaf that she had never heard
of the king's command&mdash;sat spinning.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, good old woman?" asked the princess.</p>
<p>"I am spinning, my pretty child."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the princess. "How do you do it? Let me see if I can
spin also."</p>
<p>She had just taken the spindle in her hand when, in some way, it
pricked her finger. The princess dropped down on the floor. The old
woman called for help, and people came from all sides, but nothing
could be done.</p>
<p>When the good young fairy heard the news, she came quickly to
the castle. She knew that the princess must sleep a hundred years
and would be frightened if she found herself alone when she awoke.
So the fairy touched with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
id="page177"></a>{177}</span> her magic wand all in the palace
except the king and the queen. Ladies, gentlemen, pages, waiting
maids, footmen, grooms in the stable, and even the horses&mdash;she
touched them all. They all went to sleep just where they were when
the wand touched them. Some of the gentlemen were bowing to the
ladies, the ladies were embroidering, the grooms stood currying
their horses, and the cook was slapping the kitchen boy.</p>
<p>The king and queen departed from the castle, giving orders that
no one was to go near it. This command, however, was not needed. In
a little while there sprang around the castle a wood so thick that
neither man nor beast could pass through.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>A great many changes take place in a hundred years. The king had
no other child, and when he died, his throne passed to another
royal family. Even the story of the sleeping princess was almost
forgotten.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id=
"page178"></a>{178}</span>
<p>One day the son of the king who was then reigning was out
hunting, and he saw towers rising above a thick wood. He asked what
they were, but no one could answer him.</p>
<p>At last an old peasant was found who said, "Your highness, fifty
years ago my father told me that there is a castle in the woods
where a princess sleeps&mdash;the most beautiful princess that ever
lived. It was said that she must sleep there a hundred years, when
she would be awakened by a king's son."</p>
<p>At this the young prince determined to find out the truth for
himself. He leaped from his horse and began to force his way
through the wood. To his astonishment, the stiff branches gave way,
then closed again, allowing none of his companions to follow.</p>
<p>A beautiful palace rose before him. In the courtyard the prince
saw horses and men who looked as if they were dead. But he was not
afraid and boldly entered the palace. There were guards motionless
as stone, gentlemen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id=
"page179"></a>{179}</span> and ladies, pages and footmen, some
standing, some sitting, but all like statues.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig179.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig179.jpg" alt=
"The prince finds the princess" /></a></div>
<p>At last the prince came to a chamber of gold, where he saw upon
a bed the fairest sight one ever beheld&mdash;a princess of about
seventeen years who looked as if she had just fallen asleep.
Trembling, the prince knelt beside her, and awakened her with a
kiss. And now the enchantment was broken.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id=
"page180"></a>{180}</span>
<p>The princess looked at him with wondering eyes and said: "Is it
you, my prince? I have waited for you long."</p>
<p>So happy were the two that they talked hour after hour. In the
meantime all in the palace awaked and each began to do what he was
doing when he fell asleep. The gentlemen went on bowing to the
ladies, the ladies went on with their embroidery. The grooms went
on currying their horses, the cook went on slapping the kitchen
boy, and the servants began to serve the supper. Then the chief
lady in waiting, who was ready to die of hunger, told the princess
aloud that supper was ready.</p>
<p>The prince gave the princess his hand, and they all went into
the great hall for supper. That very evening the prince and
princess were married. The next day the prince took his bride to
his father's palace, and there they lived happily ever
afterward.</p>

<h2><a name="duckling" id="duckling">THE UGLY DUCKLING</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>It was summer. The country was lovely just then. The cornfields
were waving yellow, the wheat was golden, the oats were still
green, and the hay was stacked in the meadows. Beyond the fields
great forests and ponds of water might be seen.</p>
<p>In the sunniest spot of all stood an old farmhouse, with deep
canals around it. At the water's edge grew great burdocks. It was
just as wild there as in the deepest wood, and in this snug place
sat a duck upon her nest. She was waiting for her brood to
hatch.</p>
<p>At last one eggshell after another began to crack. From each
little egg came "Cheep! cheep!" and then a little duckling's
head.</p>
<p>"Quack! quack!" said the duck; and all the babies quacked too.
Then they looked all around. The mother let them look as much as
they liked, for green is good for the eyes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id=
"page182"></a>{182}</span>
<p>"How big the world is!" said all the little ducklings.</p>
<p>"Do you think this is all the world?" asked the mother. "It
stretches a long way on the other side of the garden and on to the
parson's field, but I have never been so far as that. I hope you
are all out. No, not all; that large egg is still unbroken. I am
really tired of sitting so long." Then the duck sat down again.</p>
<p>"Well, how goes it?" asked an old duck who had come to pay her a
visit.</p>
<p>"There is one large egg that is taking a long time to hatch,"
replied the mother. "But you must look at the ducklings. They are
the finest I have ever seen; they are all just like their
father."</p>
<p>"Let me look at the egg which will not hatch," said the old
duck. "You may be sure that it is a turkey's egg. I was once
cheated in that way. Oh, you will have a great deal of trouble, for
a turkey will not go into the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page183" id="page183"></a>{183}</span> water. Yes, that's a
turkey's egg. Leave it alone and teach the other children to
swim."</p>
<p>"No, I will sit on it a little longer," said the mother
duck.</p>
<p>"Just as you please," said the old duck, and she went away.</p>
<p>At last the large egg cracked. "Cheep! cheep!" said the young
one, and tumbled out. How large it was! How ugly it was!</p>
<p>"I wonder if it can be a turkey chick," said the mother. "Well,
we shall see when we go to the pond. It must go into the water,
even if I have to push it in myself."</p>
<p>Next day the mother duck and all her little ones went down to
the water. Splash! she jumped in, and all the ducklings went in,
too. They swam about very easily, and the ugly duckling swam with
them.</p>
<p>"No, it is not a turkey," said the mother duck. "See how well he
can use his legs. He is my own child! And he is not so very ugly
either."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id=
"page184"></a>{184}</span>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Then she took her family into the duck yard. As they went along,
she told the ducklings how to act.</p>
<p>"Keep close to me, so that no one can step on you," she said.
"Come; now, don't turn your toes in. A well-brought-up duck turns
its toes out, just like father and mother. Bow your heads before
that old duck yonder. She is the grandest duck here. One can tell
that by the red rag around her leg. That's a great honor, the
greatest honor a duck can have. It shows that the mistress doesn't
want to lose her. Now bend your necks and say 'Quack!'"</p>
<p>They did so, but the other ducks did not seem glad to see
them.</p>
<p>"Look!" they cried. "Here comes another brood, as if there were
not enough of us already. And oh, dear, how ugly that large one is!
We won't stand him."</p>
<p>Then one of the ducks flew at the ugly duckling and bit him in
the neck.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id=
"page185"></a>{185}</span>

"images/fig185.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig185.jpg" alt=
"The ugly duckling and the other ducks" /></a></div>
<p>"Let him alone," said the mother; "he is doing no harm."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," said the duck who had bitten the poor duckling,
"but he is too ugly to stay here. He must be driven out."</p>
<p>"Those are pretty children that the mother has," said the old
duck with the rag around her leg. "They are all pretty but that
one. What a pity!"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the mother duck, "he is not handsome, but he is
good-tempered, and he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
"page186"></a>{186}</span> swims as well as any of the others. I
think he will grow to be pretty. Perhaps he stayed too long in the
egg."</p>
<p>"Well, make yourselves at home," said the old duck. "If you find
an eel's head, you may bring it to me."</p>
<p>And they did make themselves at home&mdash;all but the poor ugly
duckling. His life was made quite miserable. The ducks bit him, and
the hens pecked him. So it went on the first day, and each day it
grew worse.</p>
<p>The poor duckling was very unhappy. At last he could stand it no
longer, and he ran away. As he flew over the fence, he frightened
the little birds on the bushes.</p>
<p>"That is because I am so ugly," thought the duckling.</p>
<p>He flew on until he came to a moor where some wild ducks lived.
They laughed at him and swam away from him.</p>
<p>Some wild geese came by, and they laughed at the duckling, too.
Just then some guns <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
"page187"></a>{187}</span> went bang! bang! The hunters were all
around. The hunting dogs came splash! into the swamp, and one
dashed close to the duckling. The dog looked at him and went
on.</p>
<p>"Well, I can be thankful for that," sighed he. "I am so ugly
that even the dog will not bite me."</p>
<p>When all was quiet, the duckling started out again. A storm was
raging, and he found shelter in a poor hut. Here lived an old woman
with her cat and her hen. The old woman could not see well, and she
thought he was a fat duck. She kept him three weeks, hoping that
she would get some duck eggs, but the duckling did not lay.</p>
<p>After a while the fresh air and sunshine streamed in at the open
door, and the duckling longed to be out on the water. The cat and
the hen laughed when he told them of his wish.</p>
<p>"You must be crazy," said the hen. "I do not wish to swim. The
cat does not; and I am sure our mistress does not."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id=
"page188"></a>{188}</span>
<p>"You do not understand me," said the duckling. "I will go out
into the wide world."</p>
<p>"Yes, do go," said the hen.</p>
<p>And the duckling went away. He swam on the water and dived, but
still all the animals passed him by because he was so ugly; and the
poor duckling was lonesome.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Now the winter came, and soon it was very cold. Snow and sleet
fell, and the ugly duckling had a very unhappy time.</p>
<p>One evening a whole flock of handsome white birds rose out of
the bushes. They were swans. They gave a strange cry, and spreading
their great wings, flew away to warmer lands and open lakes.</p>
<p>The ugly duckling felt quite strange, and he gave such a loud
cry that he frightened himself. He could not forget those beautiful
happy birds. He knew not where they had gone, but he wished he
could have gone with them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id=
"page189"></a>{189}</span>
<p>The winter grew cold&mdash;very cold. The duckling swam about in
the water to keep from freezing, but every night the hole in which
he swam became smaller and smaller. At last he was frozen fast in
the ice.</p>
<p>Early the next morning a farmer found the duckling and took him
to the farmhouse. There in a warm room the duckling came to himself
again. The children wished to play with him, but he was afraid of
them.</p>
<p>In his terror he fluttered into the milk pan and splashed the
milk about the room. The woman clapped her hands at him, and that
frightened him still more. He flew into the butter tub and then
into the meal barrel.</p>
<p>How he did look then! The children laughed and screamed. The
woman chased him with the fire tongs. The door stood open, and the
duckling slipped out into the snow.</p>
<p>It was a cruel, hard winter, and he nearly froze. At last the
warm sun began to shine, and the larks to sing. The duckling
flapped <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id=
"page190"></a>{190}</span> his wings and found that they were
strong. Away he flew over the meadows and fields.</p>
<p>Soon he found himself in a beautiful garden where the apple
trees were in full bloom, and the long branches of the willow trees
hung over the shores of the lake. Just in front of him he saw three
beautiful white swans swimming lightly over the water.</p>
<p>"I will fly to those beautiful birds," he said. "They will kill
me because I am so ugly; but it is all the same. It is better to be
killed by them than to be bitten by the ducks and pecked by the
hens."</p>
<p>So he flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful birds.
They saw the duckling and came sailing down toward him. He bowed
his head saying, "Kill me, oh, kill me."</p>
<p>But what was this he saw in the clear water? It was his own
image, and lo! he was no longer a clumsy dark-gray bird, but
a&mdash;swan, a beautiful white swan. It matters not if one was
born in a duck yard, if one has only lain <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>{191}</span> in a
swan's egg. The other swans swam around him to welcome him.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig191.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig191.jpg" alt=
"The little children see the new swan" /></a></div>
<p>Some little children came into the garden with corn and other
grains which they threw into the water. The smallest one cried,
"Oh, see! there is a new swan, and it is more beautiful than any of
the others."</p>
<p>The ugly duckling was shy and at first hid his head under his
wing. Then he felt so happy that he raised his neck and said, "I
never dreamed of so much happiness when I was an ugly
duckling."</p>

<h2><a name="white-blackbird" id="white-blackbird">THE WHITE
BLACKBIRD</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>I was born a blackbird in a bushy thicket near a meadow. My
father took good care of his family and would peck about all day
for insects. These he brought home to my mother, holding them by
the tail so as not to mash them. He had a sweet voice, too, and
every evening sang beautiful songs.</p>
<p>I should have been happy, but I was not. I ate little and was
weak; and from the first, I was different from my brothers and
sisters. They had glossy, black feathers, while mine were dirty
gray. These made my father angry whenever he looked at them.</p>
<p>When I moulted for the first time, he watched me closely. While
the feathers were falling out and while I was naked, he was kind;
but my new feathers drove him wild with anger. I did not wonder. I
was no longer even gray; I had become snow white. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>{193}</span> I was a
white blackbird! Did such a thing ever happen in a blackbird family
before?</p>
<p>It made me very sad to see my father so vexed over me. But it is
hard to stay sad forever, and one sunshiny spring day I opened my
bill and began to sing. At the first note my father flew up into
the air like a sky-rocket.</p>
<p>"What do I hear?" he cried. "Is that the way a blackbird
whistles? Do I whistle that way?"</p>
<p>"I whistle the best I can," I replied.</p>
<p>"That is not the way we whistle in my family," my father said.
"We have whistled for many, many years and know how to do it. It is
not enough for you to be white; you must make that horrible noise.
The truth is you are not a blackbird."</p>
<p>"I will leave home," I answered with a sob. "I will go far away
where I can pick up a living on earthworms and spiders."</p>
<p>"Do as you please," my father said. "You are not a
blackbird."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id=
"page194"></a>{194}</span>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>I flew away early the next morning, and was lucky enough to find
shelter under an old gutter. It rained hard that night. I was just
about to go to bed, when a very wet bird came in and sat down
beside me. His feathers were grayish like mine, but he was much
larger than myself.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know," I replied. "I pass for a blackbird but I am
white."</p>
<p>"I am the finest bird in the world," he said. "I am a carrier
pigeon and carry messages."</p>
<p>Then I saw that a traveling bag hung from his neck.</p>
<p>"Maybe I am a pigeon," I said, "since I am not a blackbird."</p>
<p>"No," he answered, "a runt like you could not be a pigeon."</p>
<p>The next morning the pigeon sprang from the gutter and flew away
as fast as the wind. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id=
"page195"></a>{195}</span> As I was lonely, I followed him. He flew
faster and faster, but I kept up for a good while. At last my
strength gave out and I fell down into a meadow.</p>
<p>I was stunned by the fall. When I came to my senses, two birds
stood near by looking at me. One was a dainty little magpie; the
other a soft-eyed turtle dove. The magpie kindly offered me some
berries she had gathered.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig195.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig195.jpg" alt=
"The three birds meet" /></a></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
"page196"></a>{196}</span>
<p>"A blackbird or a pigeon," I said sadly. "I don't know
which."</p>
<p>"Are you joking?" she cried. "You are a magpie."</p>
<p>"But magpies are not white," I said.</p>
<p>"Russian magpies are," she answered; "perhaps you belong to that
family."</p>
<p>My joy was great for a moment at finding out what I was. Still I
was not sure that I was a magpie and thought I might settle the
matter by singing. I burst into song and warbled and whistled, and
whistled and warbled.</p>
<p>The magpie looked at me in surprise. Then her face grew sad and
she backed off from me. At last she flew away without another word.
Whatever I might be, I was not a magpie&mdash;not even a Russian
magpie.</p>
<p>I made up my mind not to rest until I found out what bird I was.
So I flew off to a place where birds of all kinds met to talk and
enjoy themselves. There were robins <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page197" id="page197"></a>{197}</span> and sparrows and crows and
wrens and martins and every sort of bird. But I was not like any of
them and whenever I began to sing, they all laughed.</p>
<p>"You are not one of us," they said; "you are a white blackbird.
That is what you are."</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>I had now seen all the birds, but none of them were as fine as
the blackbirds. I did not want to be like any of these birds; I
longed to be a blackbird, a real blackbird. That was not possible.
So I made up my mind to be content with my lot, as I had the heart
of a blackbird even if I were not black.</p>
<p>A great flock of blackbirds lived on the edge of a cornfield. I
went to them and asked them to let me be their helper.</p>
<p>"I am only a white blackbird," I said, "but I have the heart of
a true blackbird."</p>
<p>They let me stay. I waited on them early and late, bringing
straw to make nests and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id=
"page198"></a>{198}</span> tender little worms for the baby
blackbirds. The old birds were kind to me, and I began to be
happy.</p>
<p>Hard work did me good. I soon grew strong, and when the crows
tried to drive us away, I led the blackbirds to victory. My sight
was keen, and I was the first to find out that the scarecrow was
not a man. I caught more worms, too, than any of the
blackbirds.</p>
<p>By and by a strange thing happened. I saw one day that my white
feathers were speckled with brown dots. They grew larger and larger
until the dots covered me all over; I was no longer white but
brown. And now, little by little, my brown coat turned darker and
darker until one morning it was black&mdash;a rich, glossy black! I
was a blackbird at last.</p>
<p>Then the other blackbirds hopped around me with joy, crying, "He
is the largest and bravest of the blackbirds. Let him be king! Long
live the king of the blackbirds!"</p>

he walked on, forgetting his book. He sees a lad looking after a

<p>KING: Boy, I left a book lying under a tree in the park. Will
you please get it for me? If you do, I will give you a gold
piece.</p>
<p>BOY: Give me a gold piece to go to the park, indeed! You must
have a pocketful of gold pieces. Or you must think me more stupid
than I am.</p>
<p>KING: Stupid! Who thinks you stupid?</p>
<p>BOY: Why, who would be so foolish as to give me a gold piece
just for running half a mile for a book? No, no, you are joking.

<p>BOY: I only wish I could. But what would become of the geese

should have to pay trespass-money&mdash;more than the gold
piece&mdash;and lose my place besides.</p>

<h2><a name="donal" id="donal">DONAL AND CONAL</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>There was once in old Ireland a very fine lad by the name of
Donal. He was not only a very fine lad, but a very gay lad. He
would go for miles to a party or a wedding; and he was always
welcome, for Donal knew where to wear his smile. He wore it on his
face instead of keeping it in his pocket.</p>
<p>The dearest wish of Donal's heart no one knew but himself. His
soul was full of music, and he longed to have a violin.</p>
<p>One night Donal was going home through a dark forest when a
storm came up. He found an old hollow tree and got inside of it to
keep dry. Soon he fell asleep.</p>
<p>After a while Donal was awakened by a strange noise. He peeped
out, and he saw a queer sight. The storm had passed, and the moon
was shining. Many elves were dancing to strange music played by an
old, old elf.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id=
"page207"></a>{207}</span>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig207.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig207.jpg" alt=
"Donal sees the fairies dancing" /></a></div>
<p>Such queer dancing it was! Donal crept out of the tree and drew
nearer and nearer. Suddenly he laughed out loud and said, "Well,
that's the worst dancing I have ever seen!"</p>
<p>The fairies were astonished and angry, and they all began to
talk at the same time.</p>
<p>"We have a man among us!" cried one.</p>
<p>"Let us hang him!" cried another.</p>
<p>"Cut his head off!" cried a third.</p>
<p>But the queen stepped out among them and said, "Leave him to
me."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id=
"page208"></a>{208}</span>
<p>Then she called Donal to her. Now Donal was a wee bit
frightened, but he knew where to wear his smile, you remember. So
he went up to the queen, smiling and bowing.</p>
<p>"You say our dancing is the worst you have ever seen," she said.
"Now, show us that you can do better."</p>
<p>Donal smiled again and bowed low. Then he began to dance. Such
dancing the elves had never seen! They clapped their hands and made
him dance again and again. Finally, Donal was exhausted, and after
making a low bow to the queen, sat down on the ground.</p>
<p>The fairies crowded around him.</p>
<p>"Give him our silver!" cried one.</p>
<p>"Make it gold!" cried another.</p>
<p>"Diamonds!" cried a third.</p>
<p>But the queen said, "Leave it to me."</p>
<p>She went up to the old, old elf who had been playing for the
dance. Taking his violin from him, she gave it to Donal. You see,
the queen knew the dearest wish of his heart.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id=
"page209"></a>{209}</span>
<p>Then Donal was a happy lad, indeed! He thanked the queen and
went home playing on his new violin.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>There lived near Donal's home a lad named Conal. He was not such
a fine lad as Donal, nor such a gay one. He was a greedy lad, and
the dearest wish of his heart was to be rich. And he did not know
where to wear his smile. If he had one, he kept it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>When Conal heard what had happened to Donal, he wished to know
all about it. So he went to him and said, "Donal, man, how did you
get that beautiful violin?"</p>
<p>Donal told the story backward and forward, and forward and
backward, from beginning to end, until Conal knew it by heart.</p>
<p>Then Conal said to himself, "I will go to the hollow tree and
dance for the elves; but I shall not be so foolish as Donal. I will
take their gold and silver, and their diamonds, too."</p>
<p>That night Conal went to the hollow tree <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>{210}</span> and
waited until the elves appeared. Then he crept out and watched them
dance. And he said, just as Donal had, "Well, that's the worst
dancing I have ever seen!"</p>
<p>The fairies were astonished and angry again, and again they all
began to talk at once.</p>
<p>"Another man among us!" cried one.</p>
<p>"Let us hang him!" cried another.</p>
<p>"Cut off his head!" cried a third.</p>
<p>But the queen said, "Leave it to me."</p>
<p>Then she called Conal to her. Now Conal did not know where to
wear his smile, you remember; he always kept it in his pocket. So
he went up to the queen with a very sour face.</p>
<p>The queen said to him, as she had to Donal, "You say our dancing
is the worst you have ever seen. Now, show us that you can do
better."</p>
<p>Conal began to dance, and he could dance well. The elves were
delighted. They clapped their hands and asked him to dance again,
but he said roughly, "No, that is enough. Do you expect me to dance
all night?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id=
"page211"></a>{211}</span>
<p>The elves were silent then, and the queen's face was stern. But
she was a just queen, and she said, "You have danced well. Will you
have some of our silver?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Conal, without a word of thanks; and he filled his
coat pockets.</p>
<p>"Will you have gold?" asked the queen.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Conal greedily, as he filled the pockets in his
trousers.</p>
<p>"Will you have some of our diamonds?" the queen asked, and her
face was dark with anger.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," cried Conal.</p>
<p>"You shall not have them, you greedy lad!" cried the queen; "you
shall have nothing."</p>
<p>Just then a cloud passed across the moon, and the elves
vanished.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said Conal, "I have the gold and silver."</p>
<p>He plunged his hands into his pockets and lo! the gold and
silver had turned to stones. Then Conal went home a sadder and a
wiser lad.</p>

<h2><a name="killingworth" id="killingworth">THE BIRDS OF
KILLINGWORTH</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>It was spring. The apple trees and the cherry trees were pink
and white with blossoms. They filled the air with fragrance. The
maples were red, and on the oak and poplar the buds were swelling.
The brooklets were rushing and leaping on toward the sea.</p>
<p>It was spring everywhere. The robin and the bluebird were piping
sweetly in the blossoming orchard. The sparrows were chirping, and
hungry crows were calling loudly for food. The farmers of
Killingworth were plowing the fields, and the broken clods, too,
told of spring.</p>
<p>A farmer heard the cawing of the crows and the song of the
birds.</p>
<p>He said, "Did one ever see so many birds? Why, when we plant our
seeds, these birds will take them all. When the fruit ripens, they
will destroy it. I, for one, wish there were no birds, and I say
kill them all."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id=
"page214"></a>{214}</span>
<p>Another farmer said, "Yes, let us call a meeting of the people
of the village and decide what is to be done with the pests."</p>
<p>The meeting was called, and all came: the squire, the preacher,
the teacher, and the farmers from the country round about.</p>
<p>Up rose the farmer who had said he wished there were no
birds.</p>
<p>"Friends," he said, "the crows are about to take my field of
corn. I put up scarecrows, but the birds fly by them and seem to
laugh at them. The robins are as saucy as they can be. Soon they
will eat all the cherries we have. I say kill all birds; they are a
pest."</p>
<p>"So say I," said another farmer.</p>
<p>"And I," said another.</p>
<p>"And I," "And I," came from voices in every part of the
hall.</p>
<p>The teacher arose and timidly said:</p>
<p>"My friends, you know not what you do. You would put to death
the birds that make sweet music for us in our dark hours: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id=
"page215"></a>{215}</span> thrush, the oriole, the noisy jay, the
bluebird, the meadow lark.</p>
<p>"You slay them all, and why? Because they scratch up a little
handful of wheat or corn, while searching for worms or weevils.</p>
<p>"Do you never think who made them and who taught them their
songs of love? Think of your woods and orchards without birds!</p>
<p>"And, friends, would you rather have insects in the hay? You
call the birds thieves, but they guard your farms. They drive the
enemy from your cornfields and from your harvests.</p>
<p>"Even the blackest of them, the crow, does good. He crushes the
beetle and wages war on the slug and the snail.</p>
<p>"And, what is more, how can I teach your children gentleness and
mercy when you contradict the very thing I teach?"</p>
<p>But the farmers only shook their heads and laughed. "What does
the teacher know of such things?" they asked. And they passed a law
to have the birds killed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id=
"page216"></a>{216}</span>
<p>So the dreadful war on birds began. They fell down dead, with
bloodstains on their breasts. Some fluttered, wounded, away from
the sight of man, while the young died of starvation in the
nests.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The summer came, and all the birds were dead. The days were like
hot coals. In the orchards hundreds of caterpillars fed. In the
fields and gardens hundreds of insects of every kind crawled,
finding no foe to check them. At last the whole land was like a
desert.</p>
<p>From the trees caterpillars dropped down upon the women's
bonnets, and they screamed and ran. At every door, the women
gathered and talked.</p>
<p>"What will become of us?" asked one. "The men were
wrong,&mdash;something must be done."</p>
<p>"The teacher was right," said another.</p>
<p>At last, the farmers grew ashamed of having killed the birds.
They met and did away with the wicked law, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Harvest time came, but there was no harvest. In many a home
there was want and sorrow.</p>
<p>The next spring a strange sight was seen&mdash;a sight never
seen before or since. Through the streets there went a wagon filled
with great branches of trees. Upon them were hung cages of birds
that were making sweet music.</p>
<p>From all the country round these birds had been brought by order
of the farmers. The cages were opened, and once more the woods and
fields were filled with the beautiful birds, who flew about singing
their songs of joy. And again the harvests grew in the fields and
filled to overflowing the farmers' barns.</p>

<h2><a name="arbutus" id="arbutus">THE TRAILING ARBUTUS</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Many, many moons ago, in a lodge in a forest, there lived an old
man. His hair was white as the snowdrift. All the world was winter;
snow and ice were everywhere, and the old man wore heavy furs.</p>
<p>The winds went wildly through the forest searching every bush
and tree for birds to chill. The old man looked in vain in the deep
snow for pieces of wood to keep up the fire in his lodge. Then he
sat down by his dull and low fire.</p>
<p>Shaking and trembling he sat there, hearing nothing but the
tempest as it roared through the forest, seeing nothing but the
snowstorm as it whirled and hissed and drifted.</p>
<p>All the coals became white with ashes, and the fire was slowly
dying. Suddenly the wind blew aside the door of the lodge, and
there came in a most beautiful maiden.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>{219}</span>
<p>Her cheeks were like the wild rose, her eyes were soft and
glowed like the stars in springtime; and her hair was as brown as
October's nuts.</p>
<p>Her dress was of ferns and sweet grasses, her moccasins were of
white lilies, on her head was a wreath of wild flowers, and in her
hands were beautiful blossoms. When she breathed, the air became
warm and fragrant.</p>
<p>"Ah, my daughter," exclaimed the old man. "Happy are my eyes to
see you. Sit here on the mat beside me; sit here by the dying
embers. Tell me of your strange adventures, and I will tell you of
my deeds of wonder."</p>
<p>From his pouch he drew his peace pipe, very old and strangely
fashioned. He filled the pipe with bark of willow, and placed a
burning coal upon it.</p>
<p>Then he said, "I am Manito, the Mighty. When I blow my breath
about me, the rivers become motionless and the waters hard as
stone."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=
"page220"></a>{220}</span>
<p>The maiden smiling said, "When I blow my breath about me,
flowers spring up over all the meadows. And all the rivers rush
onward, singing songs of joy."</p>
<p>"When I shake my hoary tresses," said the old man, darkly
frowning, "all the ground is covered with snow. All the leaves fade
and wither."</p>
<p>"When I shake my flowing ringlets," said the maiden, "the warm
rains fall over all the land."</p>
<p>Then proudly the old man replied, "When I walk through the
forest, everything flees before me. The animals hide in their
holes. The birds rise from the lakes and the marshes, and fly to
distant regions."</p>
<p>Softly the maiden answered, "When I walk through the forest, all
is bright and joyous. The animals come from their holes. The birds
return to the lakes and marshes. The leaves come back to the trees.
The plants lift up their heads to kiss the breezes. And where-ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
"page221"></a>{221}</span> my footsteps wander, all the meadows
wave their blossoms, all the woodlands ring with music."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>While they talked, the night departed. From his shining lodge of
silver came the sun. The air was warm and pleasant; the streams
began to murmur; the birds began to sing. And a scent of growing
grasses was wafted through the lodge.</p>
<p>The old man's face dropped upon his breast, and he slept. Then
the maiden saw more clearly the icy face before her&mdash;saw the
icy face of winter.</p>
<p>Slowly she passed her hands above his head. Streams of water ran
from his eyes, and his body shrunk and dwindled till it faded into
the air&mdash;vanished into the earth&mdash;and his clothing turned
to green leaves.</p>
<p>The maiden took from her bosom the most precious flowers.
Kneeling upon the ground, she hid them all about among the
leaves.</p>

<p>"I give you my most precious flowers and my sweetest breath,"
she said, "but all who would pluck you must do so upon bended
knee."</p>
<p>Then the maiden moved away&mdash;through the forest and over the
waking fields; and wherever she stepped, and nowhere else in all
the land, grows the trailing arbutus.</p>

<h2><a name="hidden-treasure" id="hidden-treasure">HIDDEN
TREASURE</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Once upon a time there was an old farmer named John Jacobs. He
had heard that treasures were found in odd places. He thought and
thought about such treasures until he could think of nothing else;
and he spent all his time hunting for them. How he wished he could
find a pot of gold!</p>
<p>One morning he arose with a bright face and said to his wife,
"At last, Mary, I've found the treasure."</p>
<p>"No, I cannot believe it," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered; "at least it is as good as found. I am only
waiting until I have my breakfast. Then I will go out and bring it
in."</p>
<p>"Oh, how did you find it?" asked the wife.</p>
<p>"I was told about it in a dream," said he.</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"Under a tree in our orchard," said John.</p>
<p>"Oh, John, let us hurry and get it."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id=
"page224"></a>{224}</span>
<p>So they went out together into the orchard.</p>
<p>"Which tree is it under?" asked the wife.</p>
<p>John scratched his head and looked silly.</p>
<p>"I really do not know," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you foolish man," said the wife. "Why didn't you take the
trouble to notice?"</p>
<p>"I did notice," said he. "I saw the exact tree in my dream, but
there are so many trees, here that I am confused. There is only one
thing to do now. I must begin with the first tree and keep on
digging until I come to the one with the treasure under it."</p>
<p>This made the wife lose all hope. There were eighty apple trees
and a score of peach trees.</p>
<p>She sighed and said, "I suppose if you must, you must, but be
careful not to cut any of the roots."</p>
<p>By this time John was in a very bad humor. He went to work
saying, "What difference does it make if I cut all the roots? The
whole orchard will not bear one bushel of good apples <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>{225}</span> or
peaches. I don't know why, for in father's time it bore wagonloads
of choice fruit."</p>
<p>"Well, John," said his wife, "you know father used to give the
trees a great deal of attention."</p>
<p>But John grumbled to himself as he went on with his digging. He
dug three feet deep around the first tree, but no treasure was
there. He went to the next tree, but found nothing; then to the
next and the next, until he had dug around every tree in the
orchard. He dug and dug, but no pot of gold did he find.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The neighbors thought that John was acting queerly. They told
other people, who came to see what he was doing.</p>
<p>They would sit on the fence and make sly jokes about digging for
hidden treasure. They called the orchard "Jacobs' folly."</p>
<p>Soon John did not like to be seen in the orchard. He did not
like to meet his neighbors. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"
id="page226"></a>{226}</span> They would laugh and say, "Well,
John, how much money did you get from the holes?"</p>
<p>This made John angry. At last he said, "I will sell the place
and move away."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said the wife, "this has always been our home, and I
cannot think of leaving it. Go and fill the holes; then the
neighbors will stop laughing. Perhaps we shall have a little fruit
this year, too. The heaps of earth have stood in wind and frost for
months, and that will help the trees."</p>
<p>John did as his wife told him. He filled the holes with earth
and smoothed it over as level as before. By and by everybody forgot
"Jacobs' folly."</p>
<p>Soon the spring came. April was warm, and the trees burst into
bloom.</p>
<p>"Mary," said John one bright spring day, "don't you think the
blossoms are finer than usual this year?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they look as they did when your father was alive," said
his wife.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id=

<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=
"images/fig227.jpg"><img width="80%" src="images/fig227.jpg" alt=
"John's trees full of fruit" /></a></div>
<p>By and by, the blooms fell, leaving a million little green
apples and peaches. Summer passed and autumn followed. The branches
of the old trees could hardly hold up all the fine fruit on
them.</p>
<p>Now the neighbors came, not to make fun, but to praise. "How did
you do it?" they asked.</p>
<p>"The trees were old and needed attention," said John. "By
turning the soil and letting in the air, I gave them strength to
bear fruit. I have found the treasure after all, and I have learned
a lesson. Tilling the soil well is the way to get treasure from
it."</p>

<p>Once upon a time there were some wise men who lived in Gotham.
Listen and you will hear how wise they were.</p>
<p>Twelve of these wise men went fishing one day. Some went into
the stream and some stayed on dry ground. They caught many fish and
had a good time.</p>
<p>As they came home, one of the men said, "We have risked much
wading in that stream. I pray God no one of us is drowned."</p>
<p>"Why, one of us might be! Who knows?" cried another. "Let's see
about it. Twelve of us went fishing this morning. We must count and
see if twelve are returning."</p>
<p>So one man counted, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven." And he did not count himself!</p>
<p>"Alas! One of us is drowned!" he cried.</p>
<p>"Woe be unto us! Let me count," said another. And he did not
count himself.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id=
"page231"></a>{231}</span>
<p>"Alas! alas!" he wailed; "truly one of us is drowned!"</p>
<p>Then every man counted, and each one failed to count
himself.</p>
<p>"Alas! alas!" they all cried; "one of us is drowned! Which one
is it?"</p>
<p>They went back to the shore, and they looked up and down for him
that was drowned. All the time they were lamenting loudly.</p>
<p>A courtier came riding by. "What are you seeking?" he asked,
"and why are you so sorrowful?"</p>
<p>"Oh," said they, "this day we came to fish in the stream. There
were twelve of us, but one is drowned."</p>
<p>"Why," said the courtier, "count yourselves and see how many
there be."</p>
<p>Again they counted, and again each man failed to count
himself.</p>
<p>"Well, this is sad," said the courtier, who saw how the mistake
had been made. "What will you give me if I find the twelfth
man?"</p>

<p>"Sir," cried all together, "you may have all the money we
own."</p>
<p>"Give me the money," said the courtier.</p>
<p>Then he began to count. He gave the first man a whack over the
shoulders and said, "There is one."</p>
<p>He gave the next a whack and said, "There is two." And so he
counted until he came to the last man. He gave this one a sounding
blow, saying, "And here is the twelfth."</p>
<p>"God bless you!" cried all the company. "You have found our

<h2><a name="guest" id="guest">THE MILLER'S GUEST</a></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>A hunter who had ridden ahead in the chase was lost. The sun
went down, and darkness fell upon the forest. The hunter blew his
horn, but no answer came. What should he do?</p>
<p>At last he heard the sound of horse's hoofs. Some one was
coming. Was it friend or foe? The hunter stood still, and soon a
miller rode out into the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Pray, good fellow, be so kind as to tell me the way to
Nottingham," said the hunter.</p>
<p>"Nottingham? Why should you be going to Nottingham? The king and
his court are there. It is not a place for the like of you,"
replied the miller.</p>
<p>"Well, well, perhaps you are right, good miller," said the
hunter. "And yet who knows? I'll wager that the king is no better
man than I am. However, it is getting late, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>{234}</span> and
lodging I must have. Will you give me shelter for the night?"</p>
<p>"Nay, nay, not so fast," said the miller. "Stand forth and let
me see if you are a true man. Many thieves wear fine clothes these
days."</p>
<p>The hunter stepped forward. "Well, and what do you think of me?"
he asked gayly. "Will you not give a stranger lodging?"</p>
<p>"How do I know that you have one penny in your purse?" asked the
miller. "You may carry your all on your back, for aught I know.
I've heard of lords who are like that."</p>
<p>"True, good miller, but I have gold. If it be forty pence, I
will pay it," said the hunter.</p>
<p>"If you are a true man, and have the pence, then lodging you may
have. My good wife may not like it, but we'll see," said the
miller.</p>
<p>"Good!" cried the hunter. "And here's my hand on it."</p>
<p>"Nay, nay, not so fast," replied the miller. "I must know you
better before I shake hands. None but an honest man's hand will I
take."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
"page235"></a>{235}</span>
<p>"Some day, my good miller," replied the hunter, "I hope to have
you take my hand in yours. Proud will I be when the day comes."</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>And so to the miller's house they went. The miller again looked
at the stranger and said, "I like his face well. He may stay with
us, may he not, good wife?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he is a handsome youth, but it's best not to go too fast,"
said the good wife. "He may be a runaway servant. Let him show his
passport, and all shall be well."</p>
<p>The hunter bowed low, and said, "I have no passport, good dame,
and I never was any man's servant. I am but a poor courtier who has
lost his way. Pray give me lodging for the night. Your kindness I
will surely repay."</p>
<p>Then the wife whispered to the miller, "The youth is of good
manners and to turn him out would be sin."</p>
<p>"Yea, a well-mannered youth&mdash;and one who <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> knows his
betters when he sees them," the miller replied. "Let the lad
stay."</p>
<p>"Well, young man," said the wife, "you are welcome here; and
well lodged you shall be, though I do say it myself. You shall have
a fresh bed with good brown sheets."</p>
<p>"Aye," said the miller, "and you shall sleep with our own son
Richard."</p>
<p>Then they all sat down to supper&mdash;such a supper: pudding,
apple pie, and good things of all kinds. Then at a wink from the
miller, the wife brought out a venison pasty.</p>
<p>"Eat!" said the miller. "This is dainty food."</p>
<p>"Faith!" cried the hunter, "I never before ate such meat."</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" said Richard. "We eat this every day."</p>
<p>"Every day? Where do you buy it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, never a penny pay we. In merry Sherwood Forest we find it.
Now and then, you see, we make bold with the king's deer."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id=
"page237"></a>{237}</span>
<p>"Then I think that it is venison," said the hunter.</p>
<p>"To be sure. Any fool would know that," replied Richard; "but
say nothing about it. We would not have the king hear of it."</p>
<p>"I'll keep your secret," said the hunter. "Don't fear. The king
shall never know more than he knows now."</p>
<p>And so the evening passed merrily. It was late when the guest
sought his bed, but right soundly did he sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning the miller, the good wife, and Richard came out
to see the hunter on his way. Just then a party of nobles rode
up.</p>
<p>"There's the king!" cried one.</p>
<p>"Pardon, your majesty!" cried another, and all fell upon their
knees before the hunter.</p>
<p>The miller stood shaking and quaking, and for once his wife
could not speak. The king, with a grave face, drew his sword, but
not a word did he say.</p>
<p>The terrified miller threw himself at his <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>{238}</span> ruler's
feet, crying out for mercy. Again the sword was raised, and down it
fell, but lightly, upon the miller's shoulder, and the king
said:</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width:80%;"><a href=

"The king knights the miller" /></a></div>
<p>"Your kind courtesy I will repay; so I here dub thee Knight.
Rise, Sir John of Mansfield."</p>
<p>For many a day the miller and his wife told of the night the
king spent with them. And for many a day the king told of the time
he was taken for a thief and ate of his own deer in the miller's
house.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>This story I'm going to sing,</p>
<p class="i2">I hope it will give you content,</p>
<p>Concerning a silly old man</p>
<p class="i2">That was going to pay his rent,</p>

</div>
<p>A silly old man said to his wife one day, "Well, 'tis time I
paid my rent. The landlord has been away for a year and a day, but
now he is back, and I must pay for twelve months."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's twice forty pounds that is due, and it should be
paid," said the good wife. "So much money in the house keeps me
from sleeping at night."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll bridle old Tib, and away we shall go," said the old
man. "Right glad I'll be, too, to be rid of the gold."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id=
"page240"></a>{240}</span>
<p>The silly old man bridled old Tib and saddled her too. And away
they started. As he was jogging along, a stranger came riding up on
a fine horse with fine saddle bags.</p>
<p>"Good morning, old man," said the stranger.</p>
<p>"Good morning," said the old man.</p>
<p>"How far are you going?"</p>
<p>"To tell the truth, kind sir, I am going just two miles," said
the old man.</p>
<p>"And where are you going?" asked the stranger.</p>
<p>"I am going to pay my rent, kind sir," said the old man. "I am
but a silly old man who farms a piece of ground. My rent for a half
year is forty pounds; but my landlord has been away for a year, and
now I owe him eighty pounds. Right glad I am to pay it."</p>
<p>"Eighty pounds! That is indeed a large sum," cried the stranger,
"and you ought not to tell anybody you carry so much. There are
many thieves about, and you might be robbed."</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind!" said the old man. "I <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>{241}</span> do not
fear thieves. My money is safe in my saddle bags, on which I
ride."</p>
<p>So they rode along most pleasantly.</p>
<p>When they came to a thick wood, the stranger pulled out a pistol
and said, "Stand still, and give me your money."</p>
<p>"Nay," said the old man. "The money is for my landlord. I will
not give it to you."</p>
<p>"Your money or your life!"</p>
<p>"Well, if you will have it, you can go for it," cried the old
man, as he threw his old saddle bags over a hedge.</p>
<p>The thief dismounted and said, "Stand here and hold my horse
while I go over the hedge. You are silly, but surely you can do
that."</p>
<p>The thief climbed through the hedge. When he was on the other
side, the old man got on the thief's horse, and away he
galloped.</p>
<p>"Stop, stop!" cried the thief. "And half of my share you shall
have."</p>
<p>"Nay," cried the man. "I think I'll go on. I'd rather have
what's in your bag."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id=

"The old man gallops away" /></a></div>
<p>And away he galloped, riding as he never rode before.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The thief thought there must be something in the old man's bags;
so with his big rusty knife he chopped them into rags. But no money
did he find, for the silly old man was not so silly as he seemed.
His money was in his pocket.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id=
"page243"></a>{243}</span>
<p>The old man rode on to his landlord's home and paid his rent.
Then he opened the thief's bag, which was glorious to behold. There
were five hundred pounds in gold and silver.</p>
<p>"Where did you get the silver?" asked the landlord. "And where
did you get the gold?"</p>
<p>"I met a proud fool on the way," said the old man with a laugh.
"I swapped horses with him, and he gave me this to boot."</p>
<p>"Well, well! But you're too old to go about with so much money,"
said the landlord.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think no one would harm a silly old man like me," said
the farmer, as he rode away.</p>
<p>The old man went home by a narrow lane, and there he spied Tib
tied to a tree.</p>
<p>"The stranger did not like his trade, I fear," said he. "So I
think I'll take Tib home."</p>
<p>The old man went home much richer than when he left. When she
heard the story, the wife danced and sang for glee. "'Tis hard to
fool my old man," said she.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
